<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Peter Schlemihl</span>,&rdquo; one
of the pleasantest fancies of the days when Germany delighted in
romance, was first published in 1814, and was especially
naturalised in England by association with the genius of George
Cruikshank, who enriched a translation of it with some of his
happiest work as an illustrator.&nbsp; An account of the book and
its author is here reprinted at the end of the tale, as
originally given by the translator.&nbsp; To this account one or
two notes may be added.&nbsp; Louis Charles Adelaide de Chamisso
de Boncourt was born on the 27th of January, 1781, at the
Ch&acirc;teau of Boncourt, in Champagne, which he made the
subject of one of his most beautiful lyrics.&nbsp; He belonged to
a family faithful to Louis XVI., that fled to W&uuml;rzburg from
the fury of the French Revolution.&nbsp; Thus he was taken to
Germany a child of nine, and was left there when the family, with
other emigrants, returned to France in 1801.&nbsp; At fifteen he
had Teutonised his name to Adelbert von Chamisso, and was
appointed page to the Queen of Prussia.&nbsp; In the war that
came afterwards, for a very short time he bore arms against the
French, but being one of a garrison taken in the captured fort of
Hamlin, he and his comrades had to pledge their honour that they
would not again bear arms against France during that war.&nbsp;
After the war he visited France.&nbsp; His parents then were
dead, and though he stayed in France some years, he wrote from
France to a friend, &ldquo;I am German heart and soul, and cannot
feel at home here.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wandered irresolutely, then
became Professor of Literature in a gymnasium in La
Vend&eacute;e.&nbsp; Still he was restless.&nbsp; In 1812 he set
off for a walk in Switzerland, returned to Germany, and took to
the study of anatomy.&nbsp; In 1813, Napoleon&rsquo;s expedition
to Russia and the peril to France from legions marching upon
Paris caused to Chamisso suffering and confusion of mind.</p>
<p>It is often said that his sense of isolation between interests
of the land of his forefathers and the land of his adoption makes
itself felt through all the wild playfulness of &ldquo;Peter
Schlemihl,&rdquo; which was at this time written, when
Chamisso&rsquo;s age was about thirty-two.&nbsp; A letter of his
to the Councillor Trinius, in Petersburg, tells how he came to
write it.&nbsp; He had lost on a pedestrian tour his hat, his
knapsack, his gloves, and his pocket handkerchief&mdash;the chief
movables about him.&nbsp; His friend Fouqu&eacute; asked him
whether he hadn&rsquo;t also lost his shadow?&nbsp; The friends
pleased their fancies in imagining what would have happened to
him if he had.&nbsp; Not long afterwards he was reading in La
Fontaine of a polite man who drew out of his pocket whatever was
asked for.&nbsp; Chamisso thought, He will be bringing out next a
coach and horses.&nbsp; Out of these hints came the fancy of
&ldquo;Peter Schlemihl, the Shadowless Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; In all
thought that goes with invention of a poet, there are depths as
well as shallows, and the reader may get now and then a peep into
the depths.&nbsp; He may find, if he will, in a man&rsquo;s
shadow that outward expression of himself which shows that he has
been touched, like others, by the light of heaven.&nbsp; But
essentially the story is a poet&rsquo;s whim.&nbsp; Later
writings of Chamisso proved him to be one of the best lyric poets
of the romance school of his time, entirely German in his tone of
thought.&nbsp; His best poem, &ldquo;Salas y Gomez,&rdquo;
describes the feeling of a solitary on a sea-girt rock, living on
eggs of the numberless sea-birds until old age, when a ship is in
sight, and passes him, and his last agony of despair is followed
by a triumph in the strength of God.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Alone and world-forsaken let me die;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy Grace is all my wealth, for all my loss:<br />
On my bleached bones out of the southern sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy Love will look down from the starry
cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Story Without an End&rdquo;&mdash;a story of the
endless beauty of Creation&mdash;is from a writer who has no name
on the rolls of fame.&nbsp; The little piece has been made famous
among us by the good will of Sarah Austin.&nbsp; The child who
enjoyed it, and for whom she made the delicate translation which
here follows next after Chamisso&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peter
Schlemihl,&rdquo; was that only daughter who became Lady
Duff-Gordon, and with whom we have made acquaintance in this
Library as the translator of &ldquo;The Amber Witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make up the tale of pages in this little book without
breaking its uniformity, I have added a translation of the
&ldquo;Hymns to Night&rdquo; of Novalis.&nbsp; It is a
translation made by myself seven-and-forty years ago, and printed
in a student&rsquo;s magazine that I then edited.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Novalis&rdquo; was the name assumed by a poet, Friedrich
von Hardenberg, who died on the 25th March, 1801, aged
twenty-nine.&nbsp; He was bred among the Moravian brethren, and
then sent to the University of Jena.&nbsp; Two years after his
marriage to a young wife, Sophie von K&uuml;hn, she died.&nbsp;
That was in 1797.&nbsp; At the same time he lost a brother who
was very dear to him.&nbsp; It was then&mdash;four years before
his own death&mdash;that he wrote his &ldquo;Hymns to
Night.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY EPISTLE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FROM</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">A. VON CHAMISSO TO JULIUS EDWARD
HITZIG.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span>, who forget nobody, must surely
remember one Peter Schlemihl, whom you used to meet occasionally
at my house&mdash;a long-legged youth, who was considered stupid
and lazy, on account of his awkward and careless air.&nbsp; I was
sincerely attached to him.&nbsp; You cannot have forgotten him,
Edward.&nbsp; He was on one occasion the hero of our rhymes, in
the hey-day of our youthful spirits; and I recollect taking him
one evening to a poetical tea-party, where he fell asleep while I
was writing, without even waiting to hear my effusion: and this
reminds me of a witticism of yours respecting him.&nbsp; You had
already seen him, I know not where or when, in an old black
frock-coat, which, indeed, he constantly wore; and you said,
&ldquo;He would be a lucky fellow if his soul were half as
immortal as his coat,&rdquo; so little opinion had you of
him.&nbsp; <i>I</i> loved him, however: and to this very
Schlemihl, of whom for many years I had wholly lost sight, I am
indebted for the little volume which I communicate to you,
Edward, my most intimate friend, my second self, from whom I have
no secrets;&mdash;to you, and of course our Fouqu&eacute;, I
commit them, who like you is intimately entwined about my dearest
affections,&mdash;to him I communicate them only as a friend, but
not as a poet; for you can easily imagine how unpleasant it would
be if a secret confided to me by an honest man, relying
implicitly on my friendship and honour, were to be exposed to the
public in a poem.</p>
<p>One word more as to the manner in which I obtained these
sheets: yesterday morning early, as soon as I was up, they were
brought to me.&nbsp; An extraordinary-looking man, with a long
grey beard, and wearing an old black frock-coat with a botanical
case hanging at his side, and slippers over his boots, in the
damp, rainy weather, had just been inquiring for me, and left me
these papers, saying he came from Berlin.</p>

<span class="GutSmall"><i>THE SHADOWLESS MAN</i></span><span
class="GutSmall">.</span></h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> a prosperous, but to me very
wearisome, voyage, we came at last into port.&nbsp; Immediately
on landing I got together my few effects; and, squeezing myself
through the crowd, went into the nearest and humblest inn which
first met my gaze.&nbsp; On asking for a room the waiter looked
at me from head to foot, and conducted me to one.&nbsp; I asked
for some cold water, and for the correct address of Mr. Thomas
John, which was described as being &ldquo;by the north gate, the
first country-house to the right, a large new house of red and
white marble, with many pillars.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
enough.&nbsp; As the day was not yet far advanced, I untied my
bundle, took out my newly-turned black coat, dressed myself in my
best clothes, and, with my letter of recommendation, set out for
the man who was to assist me in the attainment of my moderate
wishes.</p>
<p>After proceeding up the north street, I reached the gate, and
saw the marble columns glittering through the trees.&nbsp; Having
wiped the dust from my shoes with my pocket-handkerchief and
readjusted my cravat, I rang the bell&mdash;offering up at the
same time a silent prayer.&nbsp; The door flew open, and the
porter sent in my name.&nbsp; I had soon the honour to be invited
into the park, where Mr. John was walking with a few
friends.&nbsp; I recognised him at once by his corpulency and
self-complacent air.&nbsp; He received me very well&mdash;just as
a rich man receives a poor devil; and turning to me, took my
letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, from my brother! it is a long time since
I heard from him: is he well?&mdash;Yonder,&rdquo; he went
on,&mdash;turning to the company, and pointing to a distant
hill&mdash;&ldquo;Yonder is the site of the new
building.&rdquo;&nbsp; He broke the seal without discontinuing
the conversation, which turned upon riches.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who does not possess at least a
million is a poor wretch.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, how
true!&rdquo; I exclaimed, in the fulness of my heart.&nbsp; He
seemed pleased at this, and replied with a smile, &ldquo;Stop
here, my dear friend; afterwards I shall, perhaps, have time to
tell you what I think of this,&rdquo; pointing to the letter,
which he then put into his pocket, and turned round to the
company, offering his arm to a young lady: his example was
followed by the other gentlemen, each politely escorting a lady;
and the whole party proceeded towards a little hill thickly
planted with blooming roses.</p>
<p>I followed without troubling any one, for none took the least
further notice of me.&nbsp; The party was in high
spirits&mdash;lounging about and jesting&mdash;speaking sometimes
of trifling matters very seriously, and of serious matters as
triflingly&mdash;and exercising their wit in particular to great
advantage on their absent friends and their affairs.&nbsp; I was
too ignorant of what they were talking about to understand much
of it, and too anxious and absorbed in my own reflections to
occupy myself with the solution of such enigmas as their
conversation presented.</p>
<p>By this time we had reached the thicket of roses.&nbsp; The
lovely Fanny, who seemed to be the queen of the day, was
obstinately bent on plucking a rose-branch for herself, and in
the attempt pricked her finger with a thorn.&nbsp; The crimson
stream, as if flowing from the dark-tinted rose, tinged her fair
hand with the purple current.&nbsp; This circumstance set the
whole company in commotion; and court-plaster was called
for.&nbsp; A quiet, elderly man, tall, and meagre-looking, who
was one of the company, but whom I had not before observed,
immediately put his hand into the tight breast-pocket of his
old-fashioned coat of grey sarsnet, pulled out a small
letter-case, opened it, and, with a most respectful bow,
presented the lady with the wished-for article.&nbsp; She
received it without noticing the giver, or thanking him.&nbsp;
The wound was bound up, and the party proceeded along the hill
towards the back part, from which they enjoyed an extensive view
across the green labyrinth of the park to the wide-spreading
ocean.&nbsp; The view was truly a magnificent one.&nbsp; A slight
speck was observed on the horizon, between the dark flood and the
azure sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;A telescope!&rdquo; called out Mr. John;
but before any of the servants could answer the summons the grey
man, with a modest bow, drew his hand from his pocket, and
presented a beautiful Dollond&rsquo;s telescope to Mr. John, who,
on looking through it, informed the company that the speck in the
distance was the ship which had sailed yesterday, and which was
detained within sight of the haven by contrary winds.&nbsp; The
telescope passed from hand to hand, but was not returned to the
owner, whom I gazed at with astonishment, and could not conceive
how so large an instrument could have proceeded from so small a
pocket.&nbsp; This, however, seemed to excite surprise in no one;
and the grey man appeared to create as little interest as
myself.</p>
<p>Refreshments were now brought forward, consisting of the
rarest fruits from all parts of the world, served up in the most
costly dishes.&nbsp; Mr. John did the honours with unaffected
grace, and addressed me for the second time, saying, &ldquo;You
had better eat; you did not get such things at sea.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I acknowledged his politeness with a bow, which, however, he did
not perceive, having turned round to speak with some one
else.</p>
<p>The party would willingly have stopped some time here on the
declivity of the hill, to enjoy the extensive prospect before
them, had they not been apprehensive of the dampness of the
grass.&nbsp; &ldquo;How delightful it would be,&rdquo; exclaimed
some one, &ldquo;if we had a Turkey carpet to lay down
here!&rdquo;&nbsp; The wish was scarcely expressed when the man
in the grey coat put his hand in his pocket, and, with a modest
and even humble air, pulled out a rich Turkey carpet, embroidered
in gold.&nbsp; The servant received it as a matter of course, and
spread it out on the desired spot; and, without any ceremony, the
company seated themselves on it.&nbsp; Confounded by what I saw,
I gazed again at the man, his pocket, and the carpet, which was
more than twenty feet in length and ten in breadth; and rubbed my
eyes, not knowing what to think, particularly as no one saw
anything extraordinary in the matter.</p>
<p>I would gladly have made some inquiries respecting the man,
and asked who he was, but knew not to whom I should address
myself, for I felt almost more afraid of the servants than of
their master.&nbsp; At length I took courage, and stepping up to
a young man who seemed of less consequence than the others, and
who was more frequently standing by himself, I begged of him, in
a low tone, to tell me who the obliging gentleman was in the grey
cloak.&nbsp; &ldquo;That man who looks like a piece of thread
just escaped from a tailor&rsquo;s needle?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes; he who is standing alone yonder.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; was the reply; and to avoid, as it
seemed, any further conversation with me, he turned away, and
spoke of some common-place matters with a neighbour.</p>
<p>The sun&rsquo;s rays now being stronger, the ladies complained
of feeling oppressed by the heat; and the lovely Fanny, turning
carelessly to the grey man, to whom I had not yet observed that
any one had addressed the most trifling question, asked him if,
perhaps, he had not a tent about him.&nbsp; He replied, with a
low bow, as if some unmerited honour had been conferred upon him;
and, putting his hand in his pocket, drew from it canvas, poles,
cord, iron&mdash;in short, everything belonging to the most
splendid tent for a party of pleasure.&nbsp; The young gentlemen
assisted in pitching it: and it covered the whole carpet: but no
one seemed to think that there was anything extraordinary in
it.</p>
<p>I had long secretly felt uneasy&mdash;indeed, almost
horrified; but how was this feeling increased when, at the next
wish expressed, I saw him take from his pocket three
horses!&nbsp; Yes, Adelbert, three large beautiful steeds, with
saddles and bridles, out of the very pocket whence had already
issued a letter-case, a telescope, a carpet twenty feet broad and
ten in length, and a pavilion of the same extent, with all its
appurtenances!&nbsp; Did I not assure thee that my own eyes had
seen all this, thou wouldst certainly disbelieve it.</p>
<p>This man, although he appeared so humble and embarrassed in
his air and manners, and passed so unheeded, had inspired me with
such a feeling of horror by the unearthly paleness of his
countenance, from which I could not avert my eyes, that I was
unable longer to endure it.</p>
<p>I determined, therefore, to steal away from the company, which
appeared no difficult matter, from the undistinguished part I
acted in it.&nbsp; I resolved to return to the town, and pay
another visit to Mr. John the following morning, and, at the same
time, make some inquiries of him relative to the extraordinary
man in grey, provided I could command sufficient courage.&nbsp;
Would to Heaven that such good fortune had awaited me!</p>
<p>I had stolen safely down the hill, through the thicket of
roses, and now found myself on an open plain; but fearing lest I
should be met out of the proper path, crossing the grass, I cast
an inquisitive glance around, and started as I beheld the man in
the grey cloak advancing towards me.&nbsp; He took off his hat,
and made me a lower bow than mortal had ever yet favoured me
with.&nbsp; It was evident that he wished to address me; and I
could not avoid encountering him without seeming rude.&nbsp; I
returned his salutation, therefore, and stood bareheaded in the
sunshine as if rooted to the ground.&nbsp; I gazed at him with
the utmost horror, and felt like a bird fascinated by a
serpent.</p>
<p>He affected himself to have an air of embarrassment.&nbsp;
With his eyes on the ground, he bowed several times, drew nearer,
and at last, without looking up, addressed me in a low and
hesitating voice, almost in the tone of a suppliant: &ldquo;Will
you, sir, excuse my importunity in venturing to intrude upon you
in so unusual a manner?&nbsp; I have a request to
make&mdash;would you most graciously be pleased to allow
me&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold! for Heaven&rsquo;s
sake!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;what can I do for a man
who&rdquo;&mdash;I stopped in some confusion, which he seemed to
share.&nbsp; After a moment&rsquo;s pause, he resumed:
&ldquo;During the short time I have had the pleasure to be in
your company, I have&mdash;permit me, sir, to say&mdash;beheld
with unspeakable admiration your most beautiful shadow, and
remarked the air of noble indifference with which you, at the
same time, turn from the glorious picture at your feet, as if
disdaining to vouchsafe a glance at it.&nbsp; Excuse the boldness
of my proposal; but perhaps you would have no objection to sell
me your shadow?&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped, while my head turned
round like a mill-wheel.&nbsp; What was I to think of so
extraordinary a proposal?&nbsp; To sell my shadow!&nbsp;
&ldquo;He must be mad,&rdquo; thought I; and assuming a tone more
in character with the submissiveness of his own, I replied,
&ldquo;My good friend, are you not content with your own
shadow?&nbsp; This would be a bargain of a strange nature
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have in my pocket,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;many things
which may possess some value in your eyes: for that inestimable
shadow I should deem the highest price too little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cold shuddering came over me as I recollected the pocket;
and I could not conceive what had induced me to style him
&ldquo;<i>good friend</i>,&rdquo; which I took care not to
repeat, endeavouring to make up for it by a studied
politeness.</p>
<p>I now resumed the conversation:&mdash;&ldquo;But,
Sir&mdash;excuse your humble servant&mdash;I am at a loss to
comprehend your meaning,&mdash;my shadow?&mdash;how can
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me,&rdquo; he exclaimed, interrupting me,
&ldquo;to gather up the noble image as it lies on the ground, and
to take it into my possession.&nbsp; As to the manner of
accomplishing it, leave that to me.&nbsp; In return, and as an
evidence of my gratitude, I shall leave you to choose among all
the treasures I have in my pocket, among which are a variety of
enchanting articles, not exactly adapted for you, who, I am sure,
would like better to have the wishing-cap of Fortunatus, all made
new and sound again, and a lucky purse which also belonged to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunatus&rsquo;s purse!&rdquo; cried I; and, great as
was my mental anguish, with that one word he had penetrated the
deepest recesses of my soul.&nbsp; A feeling of giddiness came
over me, and double ducats glittered before my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be pleased, gracious sir, to examine this purse, and
make a trial of its contents.&rdquo;&nbsp; He put his hand in his
pocket, and drew forth a large strongly stitched bag of stout
Cordovan leather, with a couple of strings to match, and
presented it to me.&nbsp; I seized it&mdash;took out ten gold
pieces, then ten more, and this I repeated again and again.&nbsp;
Instantly I held out my hand to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Done,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;the bargain is made: my shadow for the
purse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; he answered; and,
immediately kneeling down, I beheld him, with extraordinary
dexterity, gently loosen my shadow from the grass, lift it up,
fold it together, and, at last put it in his pocket.&nbsp; He
then rose, bowed once more to me, and directed his steps towards
the rose bushes.&nbsp; I fancied I heard him quietly laughing to
himself.&nbsp; However, I held the purse fast by the two
strings.&nbsp; The earth was basking beneath the brightness of
the sun; but I presently lost all consciousness.</p>
<p>On recovering my senses, I hastened to quit a place where I
hoped there was nothing further to detain me.&nbsp; I first
filled my pockets with gold, then fastened the strings of the
purse round my neck, and concealed it in my bosom.&nbsp; I passed
unnoticed out of the park, gained the high road, and took the way
to the town.&nbsp; As I was thoughtfully approaching the gate, I
heard some one behind me exclaiming, &ldquo;Young man! young man!
you have lost your shadow!&rdquo;&nbsp; I turned, and perceived
an old woman calling after me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you, my good
woman,&rdquo; said I; and throwing her a piece of gold for her
well-intended information, I stepped under the trees.&nbsp; At
the gate, again, it was my fate to hear the sentry inquiring
where the gentleman had left his shadow; and immediately I heard
a couple of women exclaiming, &ldquo;Jesu Maria! the poor man has
no shadow.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this began to depress me, and I
carefully avoided walking in the sun; but this could not
everywhere be the case: for in the next broad street I had to
cross, and, unfortunately for me, at the very hour in which the
boys were coming out of school, a humpbacked lout of a
fellow&mdash;I see him yet&mdash;soon made the discovery that I
was without a shadow, and communicated the news, with loud
outcries, to a knot of young urchins.&nbsp; The whole swarm
proceeded immediately to reconnoitre me, and to pelt me with
mud.&nbsp; &ldquo;People,&rdquo; cried they, &ldquo;are generally
accustomed to take their shadows with them when they walk in the
sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to drive them away I threw gold by handfuls among
them, and sprang into a hackney-coach which some compassionate
spectators sent to my rescue.</p>
<p>As soon as I found myself alone in the rolling vehicle I began
to weep bitterly.&nbsp; I had by this time a misgiving that, in
the same degree in which gold in this world prevails over merit
and virtue, by so much one&rsquo;s shadow excels gold; and now
that I had sacrificed my conscience for riches, and given my
shadow in exchange for mere gold, what on earth would become of
me?</p>
<p>As the coach stopped at the door of my late inn, I felt much
perplexed, and not at all disposed to enter so wretched an
abode.&nbsp; I called for my things, and received them with an
air of contempt, threw down a few gold pieces, and desired to be
conducted to a first-rate hotel.&nbsp; This house had a northern
aspect, so that I had nothing to fear from the sun.&nbsp; I
dismissed the coachman with gold; asked to be conducted to the
best apartment, and locked myself up in it as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>Imagine, my friend, what I then set about?&nbsp; O my dear
Chamisso! even to thee I blush to mention what follows.</p>
<p>I drew the ill-fated purse from my bosom; and, in a sort of
frenzy that raged like a self-fed fire within me, I took out
gold&mdash;gold&mdash;gold&mdash;more and more, till I strewed it
on the floor, trampled upon it, and feasting on its very sound
and brilliancy, added coins to coins, rolling and revelling on
the gorgeous bed, until I sank exhausted.</p>
<p>Thus passed away that day and evening; and as my door remained
locked, night found me still lying on the gold, where, at last,
sleep overpowered me.</p>
<p>Then I dreamed of thee, and fancied I stood behind the glass
door of thy little room, and saw thee seated at thy table between
a skeleton and a bunch of dried plants; before thee lay open the
works of Haller, Humboldt, and Linn&aelig;us; on thy sofa a
volume of Goethe, and the Enchanted Ring.&nbsp; I stood a long
time contemplating thee, and everything in thy apartment; and
again turning my gaze upon thee, I perceived that thou wast
motionless&mdash;thou didst not breathe&mdash;thou wast dead.</p>
<p>I awoke&mdash;it seemed yet early&mdash;my watch had
stopped.&nbsp; I felt thirsty, faint, and worn out; for since the
preceding morning I had not tasted food.&nbsp; I now cast from
me, with loathing and disgust, the very gold with which but a
short time before I had satiated my foolish heart.&nbsp; Now I
knew not where to put it&mdash;I dared not leave it lying
there.&nbsp; I examined my purse to see if it would hold
it,&mdash;impossible!&nbsp; Neither of my windows opened on the
sea.&nbsp; I had no other resource but, with toil and great
fatigue, to drag it to a huge chest which stood in a closet in my
room; where I placed it all, with the exception of a handful or
two.&nbsp; Then I threw myself, exhausted, into an arm-chair,
till the people of the house should be up and stirring.&nbsp; As
soon as possible I sent for some refreshment, and desired to see
the landlord.</p>
<p>I entered into some conversation with this man respecting the
arrangement of my future establishment.&nbsp; He recommended for
my personal attendant one Bendel, whose honest and intelligent
countenance immediately prepossessed me in his favour.&nbsp; It
is this individual whose persevering attachment has consoled me
in all the miseries of my life, and enabled me to bear up under
my wretched lot.&nbsp; I was occupied the whole day in my room
with servants in want of a situation, and tradesmen of every
description.&nbsp; I decided on my future plans, and purchased
various articles of vertu and splendid jewels, in order to get
rid of some of my gold; but nothing seemed to diminish the
inexhaustible heap.</p>
<p>I now reflected on my situation with the utmost
uneasiness.&nbsp; I dared not take a single step beyond my own
door; and in the evening I had forty wax tapers lighted before I
ventured to leave the shade.&nbsp; I reflected with horror on the
frightful encounter with the school-boys; yet I resolved, if I
could command sufficient courage, to put the public opinion to a
second trial.&nbsp; The nights were now moonlight.&nbsp; Late in
the evening I wrapped myself in a large cloak, pulled my hat over
my eyes, and, trembling like a criminal, stole out of the
house.</p>
<p>I did not venture to leave the friendly shadow of the houses
until I had reached a distant part of the town; and then I
emerged into the broad moonlight, fully prepared to hear my fate
from the lips of the passers-by.</p>
<p>Spare me, my beloved friend, the painful recital of all that I
was doomed to endure.&nbsp; The women often expressed the deepest
sympathy for me&mdash;a sympathy not less piercing to my soul
than the scoffs of the young people, and the proud contempt of
the men, particularly of the more corpulent, who threw an ample
shadow before them.&nbsp; A fair and beauteous maiden, apparently
accompanied by her parents, who gravely kept looking straight
before them, chanced to cast a beaming glance on me; but was
evidently startled at perceiving that I was without a shadow, and
hiding her lovely face in her veil, and holding down her head,
passed silently on.</p>
<p>This was past all endurance.&nbsp; Tears streamed from my
eyes; and with a heart pierced through and through, I once more
took refuge in the shade.&nbsp; I leant on the houses for
support, and reached home at a late hour, worn out with
fatigue.</p>
<p>I passed a sleepless night.&nbsp; My first care the following
morning was, to devise some means of discovering the man in the
grey cloak.&nbsp; Perhaps I may succeed in finding him; and how
fortunate it were if he should be as ill satisfied with his
bargain as I am with mine!</p>
<p>I desired Bendel to be sent for, who seemed to possess some
tact and ability.&nbsp; I minutely described to him the
individual who possessed a treasure without which life itself was
rendered a burden to me.&nbsp; I mentioned the time and place at
which I had seen him, named all the persons who were present, and
concluded with the following directions:&mdash;He was to inquire
for a Dollond&rsquo;s telescope, a Turkey carpet interwoven with
gold, a marquee, and, finally, for some black steeds&mdash;the
history, without entering into particulars, of all these being
singularly connected with the mysterious character who seemed to
pass unnoticed by every one, but whose appearance had destroyed
the peace and happiness of my life.</p>
<p>As I spoke I produced as much gold as I could hold in my two
hands, and added jewels and precious stones of still greater
value.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bendel,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this smooths
many a path, and renders that easy which seems almost
impossible.&nbsp; Be not sparing of it, for I am not so; but go,
and rejoice thy master with intelligence on which depend all his
hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He departed, and returned late and melancholy.</p>
<p>None of Mr. John&rsquo;s servants, none of his guests (and
Bendel had spoken to them all) had the slightest recollection of
the man in the grey cloak.</p>
<p>The new telescope was still there, but no one knew how it had
come; and the tent and Turkey carpet were still stretched out on
the hill.&nbsp; The servants boasted of their master&rsquo;s
wealth; but no one seemed to know by what means he had become
possessed of these newly acquired luxuries.&nbsp; He was
gratified; and it gave him no concern to be ignorant how they had
come to him.&nbsp; The black coursers which had been mounted on
that day were in the stables of the young gentlemen of the party,
who admired them as the munificent present of Mr. John.</p>
<p>Such was the information I gained from Bendel&rsquo;s detailed
account; but, in spite of this unsatisfactory result, his zeal
and prudence deserved and received my commendation.&nbsp; In a
gloomy mood, I made him a sign to withdraw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, sir,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;laid before
you all the information in my power relative to the subject of
the most importance to you.&nbsp; I have now a message to deliver
which I received early this morning from a person at the gate, as
I was proceeding to execute the commission in which I have so
unfortunately failed.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s words were precisely
these: &lsquo;Tell your master, Peter Schlemihl, he will not see
me here again.&nbsp; I am going to cross the sea; a favourable
wind now calls all the passengers on board; but, in a year and a
day I shall have the honour of paying him a visit; when, in all
probability, I shall have a proposal to make to him of a very
agreeable nature.&nbsp; Commend me to him most respectfully, with
many thanks.&rsquo;&nbsp; I inquired his name; but he said you
would remember him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of person was he?&rdquo; cried I, in great
emotion; and Bendel described the man in the grey coat feature by
feature, word for word; in short, the very individual in search
of whom he had been sent.&nbsp; &ldquo;How unfortunate!&rdquo;
cried I bitterly; &ldquo;it was himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scales, as
it were, fell from Bendel&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it was
he,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;undoubtedly it was he; and fool,
madman, that I was, I did not recognise him&mdash;I did not, and
have betrayed my master!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then broke out into a
torrent of self-reproach; and his distress really excited my
compassion.&nbsp; I endeavoured to console him, repeatedly
assuring him that I entertained no doubt of his fidelity; and
despatched him immediately to the wharf, to discover, if
possible, some trace of the extraordinary being.&nbsp; But on
that very morning many vessels which had been detained in port by
contrary winds had set sail, all bound to different parts of the
globe; and the grey man had disappeared like a shadow.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> what use were wings to a man
fast bound in chains of iron?&nbsp; They would but increase the
horror of his despair.&nbsp; Like the dragon guarding his
treasure, I remained cut off from all human intercourse, and
starving amidst my very gold, for it gave me no pleasure: I
anathematised it as the source of all my wretchedness.</p>
<p>Sole depository of my fearful secret, I trembled before the
meanest of my attendants, whom, at the same time, I envied; for
he possessed a shadow, and could venture to go out in the
daytime; while I shut myself up in my room day and night, and
indulged in all the bitterness of grief.</p>
<p>One individual, however, was daily pining away before my
eyes&mdash;my faithful Bendel, who was the victim of silent
self-reproach, tormenting himself with the idea that he had
betrayed the confidence reposed in him by a good master, in
failing to recognise the individual in quest of whom he had been
sent, and with whom he had been led to believe that my melancholy
fate was closely connected.&nbsp; Still, I had nothing to accuse
him with, as I recognised in the occurrence the mysterious
character of the unknown.</p>
<p>In order to leave no means untried, I one day despatched
Bendel with a costly ring to the most celebrated artist in the
town, desiring him to wait upon me.&nbsp; He came; and,
dismissing the attendants, I secured the door, placing myself
opposite to him, and, after extolling his art, with a heavy heart
came to the point, first enjoining the strictest secrecy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a person,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;who most
unfortunately has lost his shadow, could you paint a false
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you speak of the natural shadow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;by what awkward negligence
can a man have lost his shadow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How it occurred,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;is of no
consequence; but it was in this manner&rdquo;&mdash;(and here I
uttered an unblushing falsehood)&mdash;&ldquo;he was travelling
in Russia last winter, and one bitterly cold day it froze so
intensely, that his shadow remained so fixed to the ground, that
it was found impossible to remove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The false shadow that I might paint,&rdquo; said the
artist, &ldquo;would be liable to be lost on the slightest
movement, particularly in a person who, from your account, cares
so little about his shadow.&nbsp; A person without a shadow
should keep out of the sun, that is the only safe and rational
plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and took his leave, casting so penetrating a look at
me that I shrunk from it.&nbsp; I sank back in my chair, and hid
my face in my hands.</p>
<p>In this attitude Bendel found me, and was about to withdraw
silently and respectfully on seeing me in such a state of grief:
looking up, overwhelmed with my sorrows, I felt that I must
communicate them to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bendel,&rdquo; I exclaimed,
&ldquo;Bendel, thou the only being who seest and respectest my
grief too much to inquire into its cause&mdash;thou who seemest
silently and sincerely to sympathise with me&mdash;come and share
my confidence.&nbsp; The extent of my wealth I have not withheld
from thee, neither will I conceal from thee the extent of my
grief.&nbsp; Bendel! forsake me not.&nbsp; Bendel, you see me
rich, free, beneficent; you fancy all the world in my power; yet
you must have observed that I shun it, and avoid all human
intercourse.&nbsp; You think, Bendel, that the world and I are at
variance; and you yourself, perhaps, will abandon me, when I
acquaint you with this fearful secret.&nbsp; Bendel, I am rich,
free, generous; but, O God, I have <i>no shadow</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No shadow!&rdquo; exclaimed the faithful young man,
tears starting from his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! that I am born
to serve a master without a shadow!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was silent,
and again I hid my face in my hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bendel,&rdquo; at last I tremblingly resumed,
&ldquo;you have now my confidence; you may betray
me&mdash;go&mdash;bear witness against me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to be agitated with conflicting feelings; at last he
threw himself at my feet and seized my hand, which he bathed with
his tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;whatever
the world may say, I neither can nor will forsake my excellent
master because he has lost his shadow.&nbsp; I will rather do
what is right than what may seem prudent.&nbsp; I will remain
with you&mdash;I will shade you with my own shadow&mdash;I will
assist you when I can&mdash;and when I cannot, I will weep with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fell upon his neck, astonished at sentiments so unusual; for
it was very evident that he was not prompted by the love of
money.</p>
<p>My mode of life and my fate now became somewhat
different.&nbsp; It is incredible with what provident foresight
Bendel contrived to conceal my deficiency.&nbsp; Everywhere he
was before me and with me, providing against every contingency,
and in cases of unlooked-for danger, flying to shield me with his
own shadow, for he was taller and stouter than myself.&nbsp; Thus
I once more ventured among mankind, and began to take a part in
worldly affairs.&nbsp; I was compelled, indeed, to affect certain
peculiarities and whims; but in a rich man they seem only
appropriate; and so long as the truth was kept concealed I
enjoyed all the honour and respect which gold could procure.</p>
<p>I now looked forward with more composure to the promised visit
of the mysterious unknown at the expiration of the year and a
day.</p>
<p>I was very sensible that I could not venture to remain long in
a place where I had once been seen without a shadow, and where I
might easily be betrayed; and perhaps, too, I recollected my
first introduction to Mr. John, and this was by no means a
pleasing reminiscence.&nbsp; However, I wished just to make a
trial here, that I might with greater ease and security visit
some other place.&nbsp; But my vanity for some time withheld me,
for it is in this quality of our race that the anchor takes the
firmest hold.</p>
<p>Even the lovely Fanny, whom I again met in several places,
without her seeming to recollect that she had ever seen me
before, bestowed some notice on me; for wit and understanding
were mine in abundance now.&nbsp; When I spoke, I was listened
to; and I was at a loss to know how I had so easily acquired the
art of commanding attention, and giving the tone to the
conversation.</p>
<p>The impression which I perceived I had made upon this fair one
completely turned my brain; and this was just what she
wished.&nbsp; After that, I pursued her with infinite pains
through every obstacle.&nbsp; My vanity was only intent on
exciting hers to make a conquest of me; but although the
intoxication disturbed my head, it failed to make the least
impression on my heart.</p>
<p>But why detail to you the oft-repeated story which I have so
often heard from yourself?</p>
<p>However, in the old and well-known drama in which I played so
worn-out a part a catastrophe occurred of quite a peculiar
nature, in a manner equally unexpected to her, to me, and to
everybody.</p>
<p>One beautiful evening I had, according to my usual custom,
assembled a party in a garden, and was walking arm-in-arm with
Fanny at a little distance from the rest of the company, and
pouring into her ear the usual well-turned phrases, while she was
demurely gazing on vacancy, and now and then gently returning the
pressure of my hand.&nbsp; The moon suddenly emerged from behind
a cloud at our back.&nbsp; Fanny perceived only her own shadow
before us.&nbsp; She started, looked at me with terror, and then
again on the ground, in search of my shadow.&nbsp; All that was
passing in her mind was so strangely depicted in her countenance,
that I should have burst into a loud fit of laughter had I not
suddenly felt my blood run cold within me.&nbsp; I suffered her
to fall from my arm in a fainting-fit; shot with the rapidity of
an arrow through the astonished guests, reached the gate, threw
myself into the first conveyance I met with, and returned to the
town, where this time, unfortunately, I had left the wary
Bendel.&nbsp; He was alarmed on seeing me: one word explained
all.&nbsp; Post-horses were immediately procured.&nbsp; I took
with me none of my servants, one cunning knave only excepted,
called Rascal, who had by his adroitness become very serviceable
to me, and who at present knew nothing of what had
occurred&mdash;I travelled thirty leagues that night; having left
Bendel behind to discharge my servants, pay my debts, and bring
me all that was necessary.</p>
<p>When he came up with me next day, I threw myself into his
arms, vowing to avoid such follies and to be more careful for the
future.</p>
<p>We pursued our journey uninterruptedly over the frontiers and
mountains; and it was not until I had placed this lofty barrier
between myself and the before-mentioned unlucky town that I was
persuaded to recruit myself after my fatigues in a neighbouring
and little-frequented watering-place.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I must now pass rapidly over one period of my history, on
which how gladly would I dwell, could I conjure up your lively
powers of delineation!&nbsp; But the vivid hues which are at your
command, and which alone can give life and animation to the
picture, have left no trace within me; and were I now to
endeavour to recall the joys, the griefs, the pure and enchanting
emotions, which once held such powerful dominion in my breast, it
would be like striking a rock which yields no longer the living
spring, and whose spirit has fled for ever.&nbsp; With what an
altered aspect do those bygone days now present themselves to my
gaze!</p>
<p>In this watering-place I acted an heroic character, badly
studied; and being a novice on such a stage, I forgot my part
before a pair of lovely blue eyes.</p>
<p>All possible means were used by the infatuated parents to
conclude the bargain; and deception put an end to these usual
artifices.&nbsp; And that is all&mdash;all.</p>
<p>The powerful emotions which once swelled my bosom seem now in
the retrospect to be poor and insipid, nay, even terrible to
me.</p>
<p>Alas, Minna! as I wept for thee the day I lost thee, so do I
now weep that I can no longer retrace thine image in my soul.</p>
<p>Am I, then, so far advanced into the vale of years?&nbsp; O
fatal effects of maturity! would that I could feel one throb, one
emotion of former days of enchantment&mdash;alas, not one! a
solitary being, tossed on the wild ocean of life&mdash;it is long
since I drained thine enchanted cup to the dregs!</p>
<p>But to return to my narrative.&nbsp; I had sent Bendel to the
little town with plenty of money to procure me a suitable
habitation.&nbsp; He spent my gold profusely; and as he expressed
himself rather reservedly concerning his distinguished master
(for I did not wish to be named), the good people began to form
rather extraordinary conjectures.</p>
<p>As soon as my house was ready for my reception, Bendel
returned to conduct me to it.&nbsp; We set out on our
journey.&nbsp; About a league from the town, on a sunny plain, we
were stopped by a crowd of people, arrayed in holiday attire for
some festival.&nbsp; The carriage stopped.&nbsp; Music, bells,
cannons, were heard; and loud acclamations rang through the
air.</p>
<p>Before the carriage now appeared in white dresses a chorus of
maidens, all of extraordinary beauty; but one of them shone in
resplendent loveliness, and eclipsed the rest as the sun eclipses
the stars of night.&nbsp; She advanced from the midst of her
companions, and, with a lofty yet winning air, blushingly knelt
before me, presenting on a silken cushion a wreath, composed of
laurel branches, the olive, and the rose, saying something
respecting majesty, love, honour, &amp;c., which I could not
comprehend; but the sweet and silvery magic of her tones
intoxicated my senses and my whole soul: it seemed as if some
heavenly apparition were hovering over me.&nbsp; The chorus now
began to sing the praises of a good sovereign, and the happiness
of his subjects.&nbsp; All this, dear Chamisso, took place in the
sun: she was kneeling two steps from me, and I, without a shadow,
could not dart through the air, nor fall on my knees before the
angelic being.&nbsp; Oh, what would I not now have given for a
shadow!&nbsp; To conceal my shame, agony, and despair, I buried
myself in the recesses of the carriage.&nbsp; Bendel at last
thought of an expedient; he jumped out of the carriage.&nbsp; I
called him back, and gave him out of the casket I had by me a
rich diamond coronet, which had been intended for the lovely
Fanny.</p>
<p>He stepped forward, and spoke in the name of his master, who,
he said, was overwhelmed by so many demonstrations of respect,
which he really could not accept as an honour&mdash;there must be
some error; nevertheless he begged to express his thanks for the
goodwill of the worthy townspeople.&nbsp; In the meantime Bendel
had taken the wreath from the cushion, and laid the brilliant
crown in its place.&nbsp; He then respectfully raised the lovely
girl from the ground; and, at one sign, the clergy, magistrates,
and all the deputations withdrew.&nbsp; The crowd separated to
allow the horses to pass, and we pursued our way to the town at
full gallop, through arches ornamented with flowers and branches
of laurel.&nbsp; Salvos of artillery again were heard.&nbsp; The
carriage stopped at my gate; I hastened through the crowd which
curiosity had attracted to witness my arrival.&nbsp; Enthusiastic
shouts resounded under my windows, from whence I showered gold
amidst the people; and in the evening the whole town was
illuminated.&nbsp; Still all remained a mystery to me, and I
could not imagine for whom I had been taken.&nbsp; I sent Rascal
out to make inquiry; and he soon obtained intelligence that the
good King of Prussia was travelling through the country under the
name of some count; that my <i>aide-de-camp</i> had been
recognised, and that he had divulged the secret; that on
acquiring the certainty that I would enter their town, their joy
had known no bounds: however, as they perceived I was determined
on preserving the strictest <i>incognito</i>, they felt how wrong
they had been in too importunately seeking to withdraw the veil;
but I had received them so condescendingly and so graciously,
that they were sure I would forgive them.&nbsp; The whole affair
was such capital amusement to the unprincipled Rascal, that he
did his best to confirm the good people in their belief, while
affecting to reprove them.&nbsp; He gave me a very comical
account of the matter; and, seeing that I was amused by it,
actually endeavoured to make a merit of his impudence.</p>
<p>Shall I own the truth?&nbsp; My vanity was flattered by having
been mistaken for our revered sovereign.&nbsp; I ordered a
banquet to be got ready for the following evening, under the
trees before my house, and invited the whole town.&nbsp; The
mysterious power of my purse, Bendel&rsquo;s exertions, and
Rascal&rsquo;s ready invention, made the shortness of the time
seem as nothing.</p>
<p>It was really astonishing how magnificently and beautifully
everything was arranged in these few hours.&nbsp; Splendour and
abundance vied with each other, and the lights were so carefully
arranged that I felt quite safe: the zeal of my servants met
every exigency and merited all praise.</p>
<p>Evening drew on, the guests arrived, and were presented to
me.&nbsp; The word <i>majesty</i> was now dropped; but, with the
deepest respect and humility, I was addressed as the
<i>count</i>.&nbsp; What could I do?&nbsp; I accepted the title,
and from that moment I was known as Count Peter.&nbsp; In the
midst of all this festivity my soul pined for one
individual.&nbsp; She came late&mdash;she who was the empress of
the scene, and wore the emblem of sovereignty on her brow.</p>
<p>She modestly accompanied her parents, and seemed unconscious
of her transcendent beauty.</p>
<p>The Ranger of the Forests, his wife, and daughter, were
presented to me.&nbsp; I was at no loss to make myself agreeable
to the parents; but before the daughter I stood like a
well-scolded schoolboy, incapable of speaking a single word.</p>
<p>At length I hesitatingly entreated her to honour my banquet by
presiding at it&mdash;an office for which her rare endowments
pointed her out as admirably fitted.&nbsp; With a blush and an
expressive glance she entreated to be excused; but, in still
greater confusion than herself, I respectfully begged her to
accept the homage of the first and most devoted of her subjects,
and one glance of the count was the same as a command to the
guests, who all vied with each other in acting up to the spirit
of the noble host.</p>
<p>In her person majesty, innocence, and grace, in union with
beauty, presided over this joyous banquet.&nbsp; Minna&rsquo;s
happy parents were elated by the honours conferred upon their
child.&nbsp; As for me, I abandoned myself to all the
intoxication of delight: I sent for all the jewels, pearls, and
precious stones still left to me&mdash;the produce of my fatal
wealth&mdash;and, filling two vases, I placed them on the table,
in the name of the Queen of the banquet, to be divided among her
companions and the remainder of the ladies.</p>
<p>I ordered gold in the meantime to be showered down without
ceasing among the happy multitude.</p>
<p>Next morning Bendel told me in confidence that the suspicions
he had long entertained of Rascal&rsquo;s honesty were now
reduced to a certainty; he had yesterday embezzled many bags of
gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;let him enjoy his
paltry booty.&nbsp; I like to spend it; why should not he?&nbsp;
Yesterday he, and all the newly-engaged servants whom you had
hired, served me honourably, and cheerfully assisted me to enjoy
the banquet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more was said on the subject.&nbsp; Rascal remained at the
head of my domestics.&nbsp; Bendel was my friend and confidant;
he had by this time become accustomed to look upon my wealth as
inexhaustible, without seeking to inquire into its source.&nbsp;
He entered into all my schemes, and effectually assisted me in
devising methods of spending my money.</p>
<p>Of the pale, sneaking scoundrel&mdash;the unknown&mdash;Bendel
only knew thus much, that he alone had power to release me from
the curse which weighed so heavily on me, and yet that I stood in
awe of him on whom all my hopes rested.&nbsp; Besides, I felt
convinced that he had the means of discovering <i>me</i> under
any circumstances, while he himself remained concealed.&nbsp; I
therefore abandoned my fruitless inquiries, and patiently awaited
the appointed day.</p>
<p>The magnificence of my banquet, and my deportment on the
occasion, had but strengthened the credulous townspeople in their
previous belief.</p>
<p>It appeared soon after, from accounts in the newspapers, that
the whole history of the King of Prussia&rsquo;s fictitious
journey originated in mere idle report.&nbsp; But a king I was,
and a king I must remain by all means; and one of the richest and
most royal, although people were at a loss to know where my
territories lay.</p>
<p>The world has never had reason to lament the scarcity of
monarchs, particularly in these days; and the good people, who
had never yet seen a king, now fancied me to be first one, and
then another, with equal success; and in the meanwhile I remained
as before, Count Peter.</p>
<p>Among the visitors at this watering-place a merchant made his
appearance, one who had become a bankrupt in order to enrich
himself.&nbsp; He enjoyed the general good opinion; for he
projected a shadow of respectable size, though of somewhat faint
hue.</p>
<p>This man wished to show off in this place by means of his
wealth, and sought to rival me.&nbsp; My purse soon enabled me to
leave the poor devil far behind.&nbsp; To save his credit he
became bankrupt again, and fled beyond the mountains; and thus I
was rid of him.&nbsp; Many a one in this place was reduced to
beggary and ruin through my means.</p>
<p>In the midst of the really princely magnificence and
profusion, which carried all before me, my own style of living
was very simple and retired.&nbsp; I had made it a point to
observe the strictest precaution; and, with the exception of
Bendel, no one was permitted, on any pretence whatever, to enter
my private apartment.&nbsp; As long as the sun shone I remained
shut up with him; and the Count was then said to be deeply
occupied in his closet.&nbsp; The numerous couriers, whom I kept
in constant attendance about matters of no importance, were
supposed to be the bearers of my despatches.&nbsp; I only
received company in the evening under the trees of my garden, or
in my saloons, after Bendel&rsquo;s assurance of their being
carefully and brilliantly lit up.</p>
<p>My walks, in which the Argus-eyed Bendel was constantly on the
watch for me, extended only to the garden of the forest-ranger,
to enjoy the society of one who was dear to me as my own
existence.</p>
<p>Oh, my Chamisso!&nbsp; I trust thou hast not forgotten what
love is!&nbsp; I must here leave much to thine imagination.&nbsp;
Minna was in truth an amiable and excellent maiden: her whole
soul was wrapped up in me, and in her lowly thoughts of herself
she could not imagine how she had deserved a single thought from
me.&nbsp; She returned love for love with all the full and
youthful fervour of an innocent heart; her love was a true
woman&rsquo;s love, with all the devotion and total absence of
selfishness which is found only in woman; she lived but in me,
her whole soul being bound up in mine, regardless what her own
fate might be.</p>
<p>Yet I, alas, during those hours of wretchedness&mdash;hours I
would even now gladly recall&mdash;how often have I wept on
Bendel&rsquo;s bosom, when after the first mad whirlwind of
passion I reflected, with the keenest self-upbraidings, that I, a
shadowless man, had, with cruel selfishness, practised a wicked
deception, and stolen away the pure and angelic heart of the
innocent Minna!</p>
<p>At one moment I resolved to confess all to her; then that I
would fly for ever; then I broke out into a flood of bitter
tears, and consulted Bendel as to the means of meeting her again
in the forester&rsquo;s garden.</p>
<p>At times I flattered myself with great hopes from the near
approaching visit of the unknown; then wept again, because I saw
clearly on reflection that they would end in
disappointment.&nbsp; I had made a calculation of the day fixed
on by the fearful being for our interview; for he had said in a
year and a day, and I depended on his word.</p>
<p>The parents were worthy old people, devoted to their only
child; and our mutual affection was a circumstance so
overwhelming that they knew not how to act.&nbsp; They had never
dreamed for a moment that the <i>Count</i> could bestow a thought
on their daughter; but such was the case&mdash;he loved and was
beloved.&nbsp; The pride of the mother might not have led her to
consider such an alliance quite impossible, but so extravagant an
idea had never entered the contemplation of the sounder judgment
of the old man.&nbsp; Both were satisfied of the sincerity of my
love, and could but put up prayers to Heaven for the happiness of
their child.</p>
<p>A letter which I received from Minna about that time has just
fallen into my hands.&nbsp; Yes, these are the characters traced
by her own hand.&nbsp; I will transcribe the letter:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am indeed a weak, foolish girl to fancy that the
friend I so tenderly love could give an instant&rsquo;s pain to
his poor Minna!&nbsp; Oh no! thou art so good, so inexpressibly
good!&nbsp; But do not misunderstand me.&nbsp; I will accept no
sacrifice at thy hands&mdash;none whatever.&nbsp; Oh
heavens!&nbsp; I should hate myself!&nbsp; No; thou hast made me
happy, thou hast taught me to love thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, then&mdash;let me not forget my destiny&mdash;Count
Peter belongs not to me, but to the whole world; and oh! what
pride for thy Minna to hear thy deeds proclaimed, and blessings
invoked on thy idolised head!&nbsp; Ah! when I think of this, I
could chide thee that thou shouldst for one instant forget thy
high destiny for the sake of a simple maiden!&nbsp; Go, then;
otherwise the reflection will pierce me.&nbsp; How blest I have
been rendered by thy love!&nbsp; Perhaps, also, I have planted
some flowers in the path of thy life, as I twined them in the
wreath which I presented to thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, then&mdash;fear not to leave me&mdash;you are too
deeply seated in my heart&mdash;I shall die inexpressibly happy
in thy love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conceive how these words pierced my soul, Chamisso!</p>
<p>I declared to her that I was not what I seemed&mdash;that,
although a rich, I was an unspeakably miserable man&mdash;that a
curse was on me, which must remain a secret, although the only
one between us&mdash;yet that I was not without a hope of its
being removed&mdash;that this poisoned every hour of my
life&mdash;that I should plunge her with me into the
abyss&mdash;she, the light and joy, the very soul of my
existence.&nbsp; Then she wept because I was unhappy.&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; Minna was all love and tenderness.&nbsp; To save me one
tear she would gladly have sacrificed her life.</p>
<p>Yet she was far from comprehending the full meaning of my
words.&nbsp; She still looked upon me as some proscribed prince
or illustrious exile; and her vivid imagination had invested her
lover with every lofty attribute.</p>
<p>One day I said to her, &ldquo;Minna, the last day in next
month will decide my fate, and perhaps change it for the better;
if not, I would sooner die than render you miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid her head on my shoulder to conceal her tears.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Should thy fate be changed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I only
wish to know that thou art happy; if thy condition is an unhappy
one, I will share it with thee, and assist thee to support
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minna, Minna!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;recall those
rash words&mdash;those mad words which have escaped thy
lips!&nbsp; Didst thou know the misery and curse&mdash;didst thou
know who&mdash;what&mdash;thy lover&mdash;Seest thou not, my
Minna, this convulsive shuddering which thrills my whole frame,
and that there is a secret in my breast which you cannot
penetrate?&rdquo;&nbsp; She sank sobbing at my feet, and renewed
her vows and entreaties.</p>
<p>Her father now entered, and I declared to him my intention to
solicit the hand of his daughter on the first day of the month
after the ensuing one.&nbsp; I fixed that time, I told him,
because circumstances might probably occur in the interval
materially to influence my future destiny; but my love for his
daughter was unchangeable.</p>
<p>The good old man started at hearing such words from the mouth
of Count Peter.&nbsp; He fell upon my neck, and rose again in the
utmost confusion for having forgotten himself.&nbsp; Then he
began to doubt, to ponder, and to scrutinise; and spoke of dowry,
security, and future provision for his beloved child.&nbsp; I
thanked him for having reminded me of all this, and told him it
was my wish to remain in a country where I seemed to be beloved,
and to lead a life free from anxiety.&nbsp; I then commissioned
him to purchase the finest estate in the neighbourhood in the
name of his daughter&mdash;for a father was the best person to
act for his daughter in such a case&mdash;and to refer for
payment to me.&nbsp; This occasioned him a good deal of trouble,
as a stranger had everywhere anticipated him; but at last he made
a purchase for about &pound;150,000.</p>
<p>I confess this was but an innocent artifice to get rid of him,
as I had frequently done before; for it must be confessed that he
was somewhat tedious.&nbsp; The good mother was rather deaf, and
not jealous, like her husband, of the honour of conversing with
the Count.</p>
<p>The happy party pressed me to remain with them longer this
evening.&nbsp; I dared not&mdash;I had not a moment to
lose.&nbsp; I saw the rising moon streaking the horizon&mdash;my
hour was come.</p>
<p>Next evening I went again to the forester&rsquo;s
garden.&nbsp; I had wrapped myself closely up in my cloak,
slouched my hat over my eyes, and advanced towards Minna.&nbsp;
As she raised her head and looked at me, she started
involuntarily.&nbsp; The apparition of that dreadful night in
which I had been seen without a shadow was now standing
distinctly before me&mdash;it was she herself.&nbsp; Had she
recognised me?&nbsp; She was silent and thoughtful.&nbsp; I felt
an oppressive load at my heart.&nbsp; I rose from my seat.&nbsp;
She laid her head on my shoulder, still silent and in
tears.&nbsp; I went away.</p>
<p>I now found her frequently weeping.&nbsp; I became more and
more melancholy.&nbsp; Her parents were beyond expression
happy.&nbsp; The eventful day approached, threatening and heavy,
like a thundercloud.&nbsp; The evening preceding arrived.&nbsp; I
could scarcely breathe.&nbsp; I had carefully filled a large
chest with gold, and sat down to await the appointed
time&mdash;the twelfth hour&mdash;it struck.</p>
<p>Now I remained with my eyes fixed on the hand of the clock,
counting the seconds&mdash;the minutes&mdash;which struck me to
the heart like daggers.&nbsp; I started at every sound&mdash;at
last daylight appeared.&nbsp; The leaden hours passed
on&mdash;morning&mdash;evening&mdash;night came.&nbsp; Hope was
fast fading away as the hand advanced.&nbsp; It struck
eleven&mdash;no one appeared&mdash;the last minutes&mdash;the
first and last stroke of the twelfth hour died away.&nbsp; I sank
back in my bed in an agony of weeping.&nbsp; In the morning I
should, shadowless as I was, claim the hand of my beloved
Minna.&nbsp; A heavy sleep towards daylight closed my eyes.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was yet early, when I was
suddenly awoke by voices in hot dispute in my antechamber.&nbsp;
I listened.&nbsp; Bendel was forbidding Rascal to enter my room,
who swore he would receive no orders from his equals, and
insisted on forcing his way.&nbsp; The faithful Bendel reminded
him that if such words reached his master&rsquo;s ears, he would
turn him out of an excellent place.&nbsp; Rascal threatened to
strike him if he persisted in refusing his entrance.</p>
<p>By this time, having half dressed myself, I angrily threw open
the door, and addressing myself to Rascal, inquired what he meant
by such disgraceful conduct.&nbsp; He drew back a couple of
steps, and coolly answered, &ldquo;Count Peter, may I beg most
respectfully that you will favour me with a sight of your
shadow?&nbsp; The sun is now shining brightly in the court
below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood as if struck by a thunderbolt, and for some time was
unable to speak.&nbsp; At last, I asked him how a servant could
dare to behave so towards his master.&nbsp; He interrupted me by
saying, quite coolly, &ldquo;A servant may be a very honourable
man, and unwilling to serve a shadowless master&mdash;I request
my dismissal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that I must adopt a softer tone, and replied,
&ldquo;But, Rascal, my good fellow, who can have put such strange
ideas into your head?&nbsp; How can you imagine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He again interrupted me in the same tone&mdash;&ldquo;People
say you have no shadow.&nbsp; In short, let me see your shadow,
or give me my dismissal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bendel, pale and trembling, but more collected than myself,
made a sign to me.&nbsp; I had recourse to the all-powerful
influence of gold.&nbsp; But even gold had lost its
power&mdash;Rascal threw it at my feet: &ldquo;From a shadowless
man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will take nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning his back upon me, and putting on his hat, he then
slowly left the room, whistling a tune.&nbsp; I stood, with
Bendel, as if petrified, gazing after him.</p>
<p>With a deep sigh and a heavy heart I now prepared to keep my
engagement, and to appear in the forester&rsquo;s garden like a
criminal before his judge.&nbsp; I entered by the shady arbour,
which had received the name of Count Peter&rsquo;s arbour, where
we had appointed to meet.&nbsp; The mother advanced with a
cheerful air; Minna sat fair and beautiful as the early snow of
autumn reposing on the departing flowers, soon to be dissolved
and lost in the cold stream.</p>
<p>The ranger, with a written paper in his hand, was walking up
and down in an agitated manner, and struggling to suppress his
feelings&mdash;his usually unmoved countenance being one moment
flushed, and the next perfectly pale.&nbsp; He came forward as I
entered, and, in a faltering voice, requested a private
conversation with me.&nbsp; The path by which he requested me to
follow him led to an open spot in the garden, where the sun was
shining.&nbsp; I sat down.&nbsp; A long silence ensued, which
even the good woman herself did not venture to break.&nbsp; The
ranger, in an agitated manner, paced up and down with unequal
steps.&nbsp; At last he stood still; and glancing over the paper
he held in his hand, he said, addressing me with a penetrating
look, &ldquo;Count Peter, do you know one Peter Schlemihl?&rdquo;
I was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;of excellent
character and extraordinary endowments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for an answer.&mdash;&ldquo;And supposing I myself
were that very man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he exclaimed, passionately; &ldquo;he has
lost his shadow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my suspicion is true!&rdquo; cried Minna; &ldquo;I
have long known it&mdash;he has no shadow!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
threw herself into her mother&rsquo;s arms, who, convulsively
clasping her to her bosom, reproached her for having so long, to
her hurt, kept such a secret.&nbsp; But, like the fabled
Arethusa, her tears, as from a fountain, flowed more abundantly,
and her sobs increased at my approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said the ranger fiercely, &ldquo;you
have not scrupled, with unparalleled shamelessness, to deceive
both her and me; and you pretended to love her,
forsooth&mdash;her whom you have reduced to the state in which
you now see her.&nbsp; See how she weeps!&mdash;Oh, shocking,
shocking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time I had lost all presence of mind; and I answered,
confusedly, &ldquo;After all, it is but a shadow, a mere shadow,
which a man can do very well without; and really it is not worth
the while to make all this noise about such a
trifle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Feeling the groundlessness of what I was
saying, I ceased, and no one condescended to reply.&nbsp; At last
I added, &ldquo;What is lost to-day may be found
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be pleased, sir,&rdquo; continued the ranger, in great
wrath&mdash;&ldquo;be pleased to explain how you have lost your
shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here again an excuse was ready: &ldquo;A boor of a
fellow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;one day trod so rudely on my shadow
that he tore a large hole in it.&nbsp; I sent it to be
repaired&mdash;for gold can do wonders&mdash;and yesterday I
expected it home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the ranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are a suitor for my daughter&rsquo;s hand, and so are
others.&nbsp; As a father, I am bound to provide for her.&nbsp; I
will give you three days to seek your shadow.&nbsp; Return to me
in the course of that time with a well-fitted shadow, and you
shall receive a hearty welcome; otherwise, on the fourth
day&mdash;remember, on the fourth day&mdash;my daughter becomes
the wife of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now attempted to say one word to Minna; but, sobbing more
violently, she clung still closer to her mother, who made a sign
for me to withdraw.&nbsp; I obeyed; and now the world seemed shut
out from me for ever.</p>
<p>Having escaped from the affectionate care of Bendel, I now
wandered wildly through the neighbouring woods and meadows.&nbsp;
Drops of anguish fell from my brow, deep groans burst from my
bosom&mdash;frenzied despair raged within me.</p>
<p>I knew not how long this had lasted, when I felt myself seized
by the sleeve on a sunny heath.&nbsp; I stopped, and looking up,
beheld the grey-coated man, who appeared to have run himself out
of breath in pursuing me.&nbsp; He immediately began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;appointed this day; but
your impatience anticipated it.&nbsp; All, however, may yet be
right.&nbsp; Take my advice&mdash;redeem your shadow, which is at
your command, and return immediately to the ranger&rsquo;s
garden, where you will be well received, and all the past will
seem a mere joke.&nbsp; As for Rascal&mdash;who has betrayed you
in order to pay his addresses to Minna&mdash;leave him to me; he
is just a fit subject for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood like one in a dream.&nbsp; &ldquo;This day?&rdquo; I
considered again.&nbsp; He was right&mdash;I had made a mistake
of a day.&nbsp; I felt in my bosom for the purse.&nbsp; He
perceived my intention, and drew back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Count Peter; the purse is in good hands&mdash;pray
keep it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I gazed at him with looks of astonishment
and inquiry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only beg a trifle as a token of
remembrance.&nbsp; Be so good as to sign this
memorandum.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the parchment, which he held out to
me, were these words:&mdash;&ldquo;By virtue of this present, to
which I have appended my signature, I hereby bequeath my soul to
the holder, after its natural separation from my body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gazed in mute astonishment alternately at the paper and the
grey unknown.&nbsp; In the meantime he had dipped a new pen in a
drop of blood which was issuing from a scratch in my hand just
made by a thorn.&nbsp; He presented it to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
are you?&rdquo; at last I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What can it
signify?&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;do you not perceive who I
am?&nbsp; A poor devil&mdash;a sort of scholar and philosopher,
who obtains but poor thanks from his friends for his admirable
arts, and whose only amusement on earth consists in his small
experiments.&nbsp; But just sign this; to the right, exactly
underneath&mdash;Peter Schlemihl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head, and replied, &ldquo;Excuse me, sir; I cannot
sign that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;and why
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it appears to me a hazardous thing to exchange
my soul for my shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hazardous!&rdquo; he exclaimed, bursting into a loud
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, pray, may I be allowed to inquire what
sort of a thing your soul is?&mdash;have you ever seen
it?&mdash;and what do you mean to do with it after your
death?&nbsp; You ought to think yourself fortunate in meeting
with a customer who, during your life, in exchange for this
infinitely-minute quantity, this galvanic principle, this
polarised agency, or whatever other foolish name you may give it,
is willing to bestow on you something substantial&mdash;in a
word, your own identical shadow, by virtue of which you will
obtain your beloved Minna, and arrive at the accomplishment of
all your wishes; or do you prefer giving up the poor young girl
to the power of that contemptible scoundrel Rascal?&nbsp; Nay,
you shall behold her with your own eyes.&nbsp; Come here; I will
lend you an invisible cap (he drew something out of his pocket),
and we will enter the ranger&rsquo;s garden unseen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must confess that I felt excessively ashamed to be thus
laughed at by the grey stranger.&nbsp; I detested him from the
very bottom of my soul; and I really believe this personal
antipathy, more than principle or previously-formed opinion,
restrained me from purchasing my shadow, much as I stood in need
of it, at such an expense.&nbsp; Besides, the thought was
insupportable, of making this proposed visit in his
society.&nbsp; To behold this hateful sneak, this mocking fiend,
place himself between me and my beloved, between our torn and
bleeding hearts, was too revolting an idea to be entertained for
a moment.&nbsp; I considered the past as irrevocable, my own
misery as inevitable; and turning to the grey man, I said,
&ldquo;I have exchanged my shadow for this very extraordinary
purse, and I have sufficiently repented it.&nbsp; For
Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let the transaction be declared null and
void!&rdquo;&nbsp; He shook his head; and his countenance assumed
an expression of the most sinister cast.&nbsp; I continued,
&ldquo;I will make no exchange whatever, even for the sake of my
shadow, nor will I sign the paper.&nbsp; It follows, also, that
the incognito visit you propose to me would afford you far more
entertainment than it could possibly give me.&nbsp; Accept my
excuses, therefore; and, since it must be so, let us
part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Mr. Schlemihl, that you thus obstinately
persist in rejecting my friendly offer.&nbsp; Perhaps, another
time, I may be more fortunate.&nbsp; Farewell!&nbsp; May we
shortly meet again!&nbsp; But, <i>&agrave; propos</i>, allow me
to show you that I do not undervalue my purchase, but preserve it
carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he drew my shadow out of his pocket; and shaking it
cleverly out of its folds, he stretched it out at his feet in the
sun&mdash;so that he stood between two obedient shadows, his own
and mine, which was compelled to follow and comply with his every
movement.</p>
<p>On again beholding my poor shadow after so long a separation,
and seeing it degraded to so vile a bondage at the very time that
I was so unspeakably in want of it, my heart was ready to burst,
and I wept bitterly.&nbsp; The detested wretch stood exulting
over his prey, and unblushingly renewed his proposal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One stroke of your pen, and the unhappy Minna is rescued
from the clutches of the villain Rascal, and transferred to the
arms of the high-born Count Peter&mdash;merely a stroke of your
pen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My tears broke out with renewed violence; but I turned away
from him, and made a sign for him to be gone.</p>
<p>Bendel, whose deep solicitude had induced him to come in
search of me, arrived at this very moment.&nbsp; The good and
faithful creature, on seeing me weeping, and that a shadow
(evidently mine) was in the power of the mysterious unknown,
determined to rescue it by force, should that be necessary; and
disdaining to use any finesse, he desired him directly, and
without any disputing, to restore my property.&nbsp; Instead of a
reply, the grey man turned his back on the worthy fellow, and was
making off.&nbsp; But Bendel raised his buck-thorn stick; and
following close upon him, after repeated commands, but in vain,
to restore the shadow, he made him feel the whole force of his
powerful arm.&nbsp; The grey man, as if accustomed to such
treatment, held down his head, slouched his shoulders, and, with
soft and noiseless steps, pursued his way over the heath,
carrying with him my shadow, and also my faithful servant.&nbsp;
For a long time I heard hollow sounds ringing through the waste,
until at last they died away in the distance, and I was again
left to solitude and misery.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Alone on the wild heath, I disburdened my heart of an
insupportable load by giving free vent to my tears.&nbsp; But I
saw no bounds, no relief, to my surpassing wretchedness; and I
drank in the fresh poison which the mysterious stranger had
poured into my wounds with a furious avidity.&nbsp; As I retraced
in my mind the loved image of my Minna, and depicted her sweet
countenance all pale and in tears, such as I had beheld her in my
late disgrace, the bold and sarcastic visage of Rascal would ever
and anon thrust itself between us.&nbsp; I hid my face, and fled
rapidly over the plains; but the horrible vision unrelentingly
pursued me, till at last I sank breathless on the ground, and
bedewed it with a fresh torrent of tears&mdash;and all this for a
shadow!&mdash;a shadow which one stroke of the pen would
repurchase.&nbsp; I pondered on the singular proposal, and on my
hesitation to comply with it.&nbsp; My mind was confused&mdash;I
had lost the power of judging or comprehending.&nbsp; The day was
waning apace.&nbsp; I satisfied the cravings of hunger with a few
wild fruits, and quenched my thirst at a neighbouring
stream.&nbsp; Night came on; I threw myself down under a tree,
and was awoke by the damp morning air from an uneasy sleep, in
which I had fancied myself struggling in the agonies of
death.&nbsp; Bendel had certainly lost all trace of me, and I was
glad of it.&nbsp; I did not wish to return among my
fellow-creatures&mdash;I shunned them as the hunted deer flies
before its pursuers.&nbsp; Thus I passed three melancholy
days.</p>
<p>I found myself on the morning of the fourth on a sandy plain,
basking in the rays of the sun, and sitting on a fragment of
rock; for it was sweet to enjoy the genial warmth of which I had
so long been deprived.&nbsp; Despair still preyed on my
heart.&nbsp; Suddenly a slight sound startled me; I looked round,
prepared to fly, but saw no one.&nbsp; On the sunlit sand before
me flitted the shadow of a man not unlike my own; and wandering
about alone, it seemed to have lost its master.&nbsp; This sight
powerfully excited me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shadow!&rdquo; thought I,
&ldquo;art thou in search of thy master? in me thou shalt find
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I sprang forward to seize it, fancying that
could I succeed in treading so exactly in its traces as to step
in its footmarks, it would attach itself to me, and in time
become accustomed to me, and follow all my movements.</p>
<p>The shadow, as I moved, took to flight, and I commenced a hot
chase after the airy fugitive, solely excited by the hope of
being delivered from my present dreadful situation; the bare idea
inspired me with fresh strength and vigour.</p>
<p>The shadow now fled towards a distant wood, among whose shades
I must necessarily have lost it.&nbsp; Seeing this, my heart beat
wild with fright, my ardour increased and lent wings to my
speed.&nbsp; I was evidently gaining on the shadow&mdash;I came
nearer and nearer&mdash;I was within reach of it, when it
suddenly stopped and turned towards me.&nbsp; Like a lion darting
on its prey, I made a powerful spring and fell unexpectedly upon
a hard substance.&nbsp; Then followed, from an invisible hand,
the most terrible blows in the ribs that anyone ever
received.&nbsp; The effect of my terror made me endeavour
convulsively to strike and grasp at the unseen object before
me.&nbsp; The rapidity of my motions brought me to the ground,
where I lay stretched out with a man under me, whom I held tight,
and who now became visible.</p>
<p>The whole affair was now explained.&nbsp; The man had
undoubtedly possessed the bird&rsquo;s nest which communicates
its charm of invisibility to its possessor, though not equally so
to his shadow; and this nest he had now thrown away.&nbsp; I
looked all round, and soon discovered the shadow of this
invisible nest.&nbsp; I sprang towards it, and was fortunate
enough to seize the precious booty, and immediately became
invisible and shadowless.</p>
<p>The moment the man regained his feet he looked all round over
the wide sunny plain to discover his fortunate vanquisher, but
could see neither him nor his shadow, the latter seeming
particularly to be the object of his search: for previous to our
encounter he had not had leisure to observe that I was
shadowless, and he could not be aware of it.&nbsp; Becoming
convinced that all traces of me were lost, he began to tear his
hair, and give himself up to all the frenzy of despair.&nbsp; In
the meantime, this newly acquired treasure communicated to me
both the ability and the desire to mix again among mankind.</p>
<p>I was at a loss for a pretext to vindicate this unjust
robbery&mdash;or, rather, so deadened had I become, I felt no
need of a pretext; and in order to dissipate every idea of the
kind, I hastened on, regardless of the unhappy man, whose fearful
lamentations long resounded in my ears.&nbsp; Such, at the time,
were my impressions of all the circumstances of this affair.</p>
<p>I now ardently desired to return to the ranger&rsquo;s garden,
in order to ascertain in person the truth of the information
communicated by the odious unknown; but I knew not where I was,
until, ascending an eminence to take a survey of the surrounding
country, I perceived, from its summit, the little town and the
gardens almost at my feet.&nbsp; My heart beat violently, and
tears of a nature very different from those I had lately shed
filled my eyes.&nbsp; I should, then, once more behold her!</p>
<p>Anxiety now hastened my steps.&nbsp; Unseen I met some
peasants coming from the town; they were talking of me, of
Rascal, and of the ranger.&nbsp; I would not stay to listen to
their conversation, but proceeded on.&nbsp; My bosom thrilled
with expectation as I entered the garden.&nbsp; At this moment I
heard something like a hollow laugh which caused me involuntarily
to shudder.&nbsp; I cast a rapid glance around, but could see no
one.&nbsp; I passed on; presently I fancied I heard the sound of
footsteps close to me, but no one was within sight.&nbsp; My ears
must have deceived me.</p>
<p>It was early; no one was in Count Peter&rsquo;s
bower&mdash;the gardens were deserted.&nbsp; I traversed all the
well-known paths, and penetrated even to the dwelling-house
itself.&nbsp; The same rustling sound became now more and more
audible.&nbsp; With anguished feelings I sat down on a seat
placed in the sunny space before the door, and actually felt some
invisible fiend take a place by me, and heard him utter a
sarcastic laugh.&nbsp; The key was turned in the door, which was
opened.&nbsp; The forest-master appeared with a paper in his
hand.&nbsp; Suddenly my head was, as it were, enveloped in a
mist.&nbsp; I looked up, and, oh horror! the grey-coated man was
at my side, peering in my face with a satanic grin.&nbsp; He had
extended the mist-cap he wore over my head.&nbsp; His shadow and
my own were lying together at his feet in perfect amity.&nbsp; He
kept twirling in his hand the well-known parchment with an air of
indifference; and while the ranger, absorbed in thought, and
intent upon his paper, paced up and down the arbour, my tormentor
confidentially leaned towards me, and whispered, &ldquo;So, Mr.
Schlemihl, you have at length accepted my invitation; and here we
sit, two heads under one hood, as the saying is.&nbsp; Well,
well, all in good time.&nbsp; But now you can return me my
bird&rsquo;s nest&mdash;you have no further occasion for it; and
I am sure you are too honourable a man to withhold it from
me.&nbsp; No need of thanks, I assure you; I had infinite
pleasure in lending it to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took it out of my
unresisting hand, put it into his pocket, and then broke into so
loud a laugh at my expense, that the forest-master turned round,
startled at the sound.&nbsp; I was petrified.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
must acknowledge,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that in our
position a hood is much more convenient.&nbsp; It serves to
conceal not only a man, but his shadow, or as many shadows as he
chooses to carry.&nbsp; I, for instance, to-day bring two, you
perceive.&rdquo;&nbsp; He laughed again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
notice, Schlemihl, that what a man refuses to do with a good
grace in the first instance, he is always in the end compelled to
do.&nbsp; I am still of opinion that you ought to redeem your
shadow and claim your bride (for it is yet time); and as to
Rascal, he shall dangle at a rope&rsquo;s end&mdash;no difficult
matter, so long as we can find a bit.&nbsp; As a mark of
friendship I will give you my cap into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother now came out, and the following conversation took
place: &ldquo;What is Minna doing?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She is
weeping.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Silly child! what good can that
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;None, certainly; but it is so soon to
bestow her hand on another.&nbsp; O husband, you are too harsh to
your poor child.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, wife; you view things in
a wrong light.&nbsp; When she finds herself the wife of a wealthy
and honourable man, her tears will soon cease; she will waken out
of a dream, as it were, happy and grateful to Heaven and to her
parents, as you will see.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven grant it may
be so!&rdquo; replied the wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has, indeed, now
considerable property; but after the noise occasioned by her
unlucky affair with that adventurer, do you imagine that she is
likely soon to meet with so advantageous a match as Mr.
Rascal?&nbsp; Do you know the extent of Mr. Rascal&rsquo;s
influence and wealth?&nbsp; Why, he has purchased with ready
money, in this country, six millions of landed property, free
from all encumbrances.&nbsp; I have had all the documents in my
hands.&nbsp; It was he who outbid me everywhere when I was about
to make a desirable purchase; and, besides, he has bills on Mr.
Thomas John&rsquo;s house to the amount of three millions and a
half.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He must have been a prodigious
thief!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How foolishly you talk! he wisely
saved where others squandered their property.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;A mere livery-servant!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nonsense! he
has at all events an unexceptionable shadow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;True, but . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>While this conversation was passing, the grey-coated man
looked at me with a satirical smile.</p>
<p>The door opened, and Minna entered, leaning on the arm of her
female attendant, silent tears flowing down her fair but pallid
face.&nbsp; She seated herself in the chair which had been placed
for her under the lime-trees, and her father took a stool by her
side.&nbsp; He gently raised her hand; and as her tears flowed
afresh, he addressed her in the most affectionate
manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own dear, good child&mdash;my Minna&mdash;will act
reasonably, and not afflict her poor old father, who only wishes
to make her happy.&nbsp; My dearest child, this blow has shaken
you&mdash;dreadfully, I know it; but you have been saved, as by a
miracle, from a miserable fate, my Minna.&nbsp; You loved the
unworthy villain most tenderly before his treachery was
discovered: I feel all this, Minna; and far be it from me to
reproach you for it&mdash;in fact, I myself loved him so long as
I considered him to be a person of rank: you now see yourself how
differently it has turned out.&nbsp; Every dog has a shadow; and
the idea of my child having been on the eve of uniting herself to
a man who . . . but I am sure you will think no more of
him.&nbsp; A suitor has just appeared for you in the person of a
man who does not fear the sun&mdash;an honourable man&mdash;no
prince indeed, but a man worth ten millions of golden ducats
sterling&mdash;a sum nearly ten times larger than your fortune
consists of&mdash;a man, too, who will make my dear child
happy&mdash;nay, do not oppose me&mdash;be my own good, dutiful
child&mdash;allow your loving father to provide for you, and to
dry up these tears.&nbsp; Promise to bestow your hand on Mr.
Rascal.&nbsp; Speak my child: will you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minna could scarcely summon strength to reply that she had now
no longer any hopes or desires on earth, and that she was
entirely at her father&rsquo;s disposal.&nbsp; Rascal was
therefore immediately sent for, and entered the room with his
usual forwardness; but Minima in the meantime had swooned
away.</p>
<p>My detested companion looked at me indignantly, and whispered,
&ldquo;Can you endure this?&nbsp; Have you no blood in your
veins?&rdquo;&nbsp; He instantly pricked my finger, which
bled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, positively,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;you have some blood left!&mdash;come, sign.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The parchment and pen were in my hand!</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">submit</span> myself to thy judgment, my
dear Chamisso; I do not seek to bias it.&nbsp; I have long been a
rigid censor of myself, and nourished at my heart the worm of
remorse.&nbsp; This critical moment of my life is ever present to
my soul, and I dare only cast a hesitating glance at it, with a
deep sense of humiliation and grief.&nbsp; Ah, my dear friend, he
who once permits himself thoughtlessly to deviate but one step
from the right road, will imperceptibly find himself involved in
various intricate paths, all leading him farther and farther
astray.&nbsp; In vain he beholds the guiding-stars of Heaven
shining before him.&nbsp; No choice is left him&mdash;he must
descend the precipice, and offer himself up a sacrifice to his
fate.&nbsp; After the false step which I had rashly made, and
which entailed a curse upon me, I had, in the wantonness of
passion, entangled one in my fate who had staked all her
happiness upon me.&nbsp; What was left for me to do in a case
where I had brought another into misery, but to make a desperate
leap in the dark to save her?&mdash;the last, the only means of
rescue presented itself.&nbsp; Think not so meanly of me,
Chamisso, as to imagine that I would have shrunk from any
sacrifice on my part.&nbsp; In such a case it would have been but
a poor ransom.&nbsp; No, Chamisso; but my whole soul was filled
with unconquerable hatred to the cringing knave and his crooked
ways.&nbsp; I might be doing him injustice; but I shuddered at
the bare idea of entering into any fresh compact with him.&nbsp;
But here a circumstance took place which entirely changed the
face of things . . .</p>
<p>I know not whether to ascribe it to excitement of mind,
exhaustion of physical strength (for during the last few days I
had scarcely tasted anything), or the antipathy I felt to the
society of my fiendish companion; but just as I was about to sign
the fatal paper, I fell into a deep swoon, and remained for a
long time as if dead.&nbsp; The first sounds which greeted my ear
on recovering my consciousness were those of cursing and
imprecation; I opened my eyes&mdash;it was dusk; my hateful
companion was overwhelming me with reproaches.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
not this behaving like an old woman?&nbsp; Come, rise up, and
finish quickly what you were going to do; or perhaps you have
changed your determination, and prefer to lie groaning
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I raised myself with difficulty from the ground and gazed
around me without speaking a word.&nbsp; It was late in the
evening, and I heard strains of festive music proceeding from the
ranger&rsquo;s brilliantly illuminated house; groups of company
were lounging about the gardens; two persons approached, and
seating themselves on the bench I had lately occupied, began to
converse on the subject of the marriage which had taken place
that morning between the wealthy Mr. Rascal and Minima.&nbsp; All
was then over.</p>
<p>I tore off the cap which rendered me invisible; and my
companion having disappeared, I plunged in silence into the
thickest gloom of the grove, rapidly passed Count Peter&rsquo;s
bower towards the entrance-gate; but my tormentor still haunted
me, and loaded me with reproaches.&nbsp; &ldquo;And is this all
the gratitude I am to expect from you, Mr. Schlemihl&mdash;you,
whom I have been watching all the weary day, until you should
recover from your nervous attack?&nbsp; What a fool&rsquo;s part
I have been enacting!&nbsp; It is of no use flying from me, Mr.
Perverse&mdash;we are inseparable&mdash;you have my gold, I have
your shadow; this exchange deprives us both of peace.&nbsp; Did
you ever hear of a man&rsquo;s shadow leaving him?&mdash;yours
follows me until you receive it again into favour, and thus free
me from it.&nbsp; Disgust and weariness sooner or later will
compel you to do what you should have done gladly at first.&nbsp;
In vain you strive with fate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued unceasingly in the same tone, uttering constant
sarcasms about the gold and the shadow, till I was completely
bewildered.&nbsp; To fly from him was impossible.&nbsp; I had
pursued my way through the empty streets towards my own house,
which I could scarcely recognise&mdash;the windows were broken to
pieces, no light was visible, the doors were shut, and the bustle
of domestics had ceased.&nbsp; My companion burst into a loud
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you see the
state of things: however, you will find your friend Bendel at
home; he was sent back the other day so fatigued, that I assure
you he has never left the house since.&nbsp; He will have a fine
story to tell!&nbsp; So I wish you a very good night&mdash;may we
shortly meet again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had repeatedly rung the bell: at last a light appeared; and
Bendel inquired from within who was there.&nbsp; The poor fellow
could scarcely contain himself at the sound of my voice.&nbsp;
The door flew open, and we were locked in each other&rsquo;s
arms.&nbsp; I found him sadly changed; he was looking ill and
feeble.&nbsp; I, too, was altered; my hair had become quite
grey.&nbsp; He conducted me through the desolate apartments to an
inner room, which had escaped the general wreck.&nbsp; After
partaking of some refreshment, we seated ourselves; and, with
fresh lamentations, he began to tell me that the grey withered
old man whom he had met with my shadow had insensibly led him
such a zig-zag race, that he had lost all traces of me, and at
last sank down exhausted with fatigue; that, unable to find me,
he had returned home, when, shortly after the mob, at
Rascal&rsquo;s instigation, assembled violently before the house,
broke the windows, and by all sorts of excesses completely
satiated their fury.&nbsp; Thus had they treated their
benefactor.&nbsp; My servants had fled in all directions.&nbsp;
The police had banished me from the town as a suspicious
character, and granted me an interval of twenty-four hours to
leave the territory.&nbsp; Bendel added many particulars as to
the information I had already obtained respecting Rascal&rsquo;s
wealth and marriage.&nbsp; This villain, it seems&mdash;who was
the author of all the measures taken against me&mdash;became
possessed of my secret nearly from the beginning, and, tempted by
the love of money, had supplied himself with a key to my chest,
and from that time had been laying the foundation of his present
wealth.&nbsp; Bendel related all this with many tears, and wept
for joy that I was once more safely restored to him, after all
his fears and anxieties for me.&nbsp; In me, however, such a
state of things only awoke despair.</p>
<p>My dreadful fate now stared me in the face in all its gigantic
and unchangeable horror.&nbsp; The source of tears was exhausted
within me; no groans escaped my breast; but with cool
indifference I bared my unprotected head to the blast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bendel,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you know my fate; this heavy
visitation is a punishment for my early sins: but as for thee, my
innocent friend, I can no longer permit thee to share my
destiny.&nbsp; I will depart this very night&mdash;saddle me a
horse&mdash;I will set out alone.&nbsp; Remain here,
Bendel&mdash;I insist upon it: there must be some chests of gold
still left in the house&mdash;take them, they are thine.&nbsp; I
shall be a restless and solitary wanderer on the face of the
earth; but should better days arise, and fortune once more smile
propitiously on me, then I will not forget thy steady fidelity;
for in hours of deep distress thy faithful bosom has been the
depository of my sorrows.&rdquo;&nbsp; With a bursting heart, the
worthy Bendel prepared to obey this last command of his master;
for I was deaf to all his arguments and blind to his tears.&nbsp;
My horse was brought&mdash;I pressed my weeping friend to my
bosom&mdash;threw myself into the saddle, and, under the friendly
shades of night, quitted this sepulchre of my existence,
indifferent which road my horse should take; for now on this side
the grave I had neither wishes, hopes, nor fears.</p>
<p>After a short time I was joined by a traveller on foot, who,
after walking for a while by the side of my horse, observed that
as we both seemed to be travelling the same road, he should beg
my permission to lay his cloak on the horse&rsquo;s back behind
me, to which I silently assented.&nbsp; He thanked me with easy
politeness for this trifling favour, praised my horse, and then
took occasion to extol the happiness and the power of the rich,
and fell, I scarcely know how, into a sort of conversation with
himself, in which I merely acted the part of listener.&nbsp; He
unfolded his views of human life and of the world, and, touching
on metaphysics, demanded an answer from that cloudy science to
the question of questions&mdash;the answer that should solve all
mysteries.&nbsp; He deduced one problem from another in a very
lucid manner, and then proceeded to their solution.</p>
<p>You may remember, my dear friend, that after having run
through the school-philosophy, I became sensible of my unfitness
for metaphysical speculations, and therefore totally abstained
from engaging in them.&nbsp; Since then I have acquiesced in some
things, and abandoned all hope of comprehending others; trusting,
as you advised me, to my own plain sense and the voice of
conscience to direct and, if possible, maintain me in the right
path.</p>
<p>Now this skilful rhetorician seemed to me to expend great
skill in rearing a firmly-constructed edifice, towering aloft on
its own self-supported basis, but resting on, and upheld by, some
internal principle of necessity.&nbsp; I regretted in it the
total absence of what I desired to find; and thus it seemed a
mere work of art, serving only by its elegance and exquisite
finish to captivate the eye.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I listened with
pleasure to this eloquently gifted man, who diverted my attention
from my own sorrows to the speaker; and he would have secured my
entire acquiescence if he had appealed to my heart as well as to
my judgment.</p>
<p>In the meantime the hours had passed away, and morning had
already dawned imperceptibly in the horizon; looking up, I
shuddered as I beheld in the east all those splendid hues that
announce the rising sun.&nbsp; At this hour, when all natural
shadows are seen in their full proportions, not a fence or a
shelter of any kind could I descry in this open country, and I
was not alone!&nbsp; I cast a glance at my companion, and
shuddered again&mdash;it was the man in the grey coat
himself!&nbsp; He laughed at my surprise, and said, without
giving me time to speak: &ldquo;You see, according to the fashion
of this world, mutual convenience binds us together for a time:
there is plenty of time to think of parting.&nbsp; The road here
along the mountain, which perhaps has escaped your notice, is the
only one that you can prudently take; into the valley you dare
not descend&mdash;the path over the mountain would but reconduct
you to the town which you have left&mdash;my road, too, lies this
way.&nbsp; I perceive you change colour at the rising sun&mdash;I
have no objections to let you have the loan of your shadow during
our journey, and in return you may not be indisposed to tolerate
my society.&nbsp; You have now no Bendel; but I will act for
him.&nbsp; I regret that you are not over-fond of me; but that
need not prevent you from accepting my poor services.&nbsp; The
devil is not so black as he is painted.&nbsp; Yesterday you
provoked me, I own; but now that is all forgotten, and you must
confess I have this day succeeded in beguiling the wearisomeness
of your journey.&nbsp; Come, take your shadow, and make trial of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun had risen, and we were meeting with passengers; so I
reluctantly consented.&nbsp; With a smile, he immediately let my
shadow glide down to the ground; and I beheld it take its place
by that of my horse, and gaily trot along with me.&nbsp; My
feelings were anything but pleasant.&nbsp; I rode through groups
of country people, who respectfully made way for the well-mounted
stranger.&nbsp; Thus I proceeded, occasionally stealing a
sidelong glance with a beating heart from my horse at the shadow
once my own, but now, alas, accepted as a loan from a stranger,
or rather a fiend.&nbsp; He moved on carelessly at my side,
whistling a song.&nbsp; He being on foot, and I on horseback, the
temptation to hazard a silly project occurred to me; so, suddenly
turning my bridle, I set spurs to my horse, and at full gallop
struck into a by-path; but my shadow, on the sudden movement of
my horse, glided away, and stood on the road quietly awaiting the
approach of its legal owner.&nbsp; I was obliged to return
abashed towards the grey man; but he very coolly finished his
song, and with a laugh set my shadow to rights again, reminding
me that it was at my option to have it irrevocably fixed to me,
by purchasing it on just and equitable terms.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hold
you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by the shadow; and you seek in vain
to get rid of me.&nbsp; A rich man like you requires a shadow,
unquestionably; and you are to blame for not having seen this
sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now continued my journey on the same road; every convenience
and even luxury of life was mine; I moved about in peace and
freedom, for I possessed a shadow, though a borrowed one; and all
the respect due to wealth was paid to me.&nbsp; But a deadly
disease preyed on my heart.&nbsp; My extraordinary companion, who
gave himself out to be the humble attendant of the richest
individual in the world, was remarkable for his dexterity; in
short, his singular address and promptitude admirably fitted him
to be the very <i>beau ideal</i> of a rich man&rsquo;s
lacquey.&nbsp; But he never stirred from my side, and tormented
me with constant assurances that a day would most certainly come
when, if it were only to get rid of him, I should gladly comply
with his terms, and redeem my shadow.&nbsp; Thus he became as
irksome as he was hateful to me.&nbsp; I really stood in awe of
him&mdash;I had placed myself in his power.&nbsp; Since he had
effected my return to the pleasures of the world, which I had
resolved to shun, he had the perfect mastery of me.&nbsp; His
eloquence was irresistible, and at times I almost thought he was
in the right.&nbsp; A shadow is indeed necessary to a man of
fortune; and if I chose to maintain the position in which he had
placed me, there was only one means of doing so.&nbsp; But on one
point I was immovable: since I had sacrificed my love for Minna,
and thereby blighted the happiness of my whole life, I would not
now, for all the shadows in the universe be induced to sign away
my soul to this being&mdash;I knew not how it might end.</p>
<p>One day we were sitting by the entrance of a cavern, much
visited by strangers, who ascended the mountain: the rushing
noise of a subterranean torrent resounded from the fathomless
abyss, the depths of which exceeded all calculation.&nbsp; He
was, according to his favourite custom, employing all the powers
of his lavish fancy, and all the charm of the most brilliant
colouring, to depict to me what I might effect in the world by
virtue of my purse, when once I had recovered my shadow.&nbsp;
With my elbows resting on my knees, I kept my face concealed in
my hands, and listened to the false fiend, my heart torn between
the temptation and my determined opposition to it.&nbsp; Such
indecision I could no longer endure, and resolved on one decisive
effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to forget,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I
tolerate your presence only on certain conditions, and that I am
to retain perfect freedom of action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have but to command, I depart,&rdquo; was all his
reply.</p>
<p>The threat was familiar to me; I was silent.&nbsp; He then
began to fold up my shadow.&nbsp; I turned pale, but allowed him
to continue.&nbsp; A long silence ensued, which he was the first
to break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot endure me, Mr. Schlemihl&mdash;you hate
me&mdash;I am aware of it&mdash;but why?&mdash;is it, perhaps,
because you attacked me on the open plain, in order to rob me of
my invisible bird&rsquo;s nest? or is it because you thievishly
endeavoured to seduce away the shadow with which I had entrusted
you&mdash;my own property&mdash;confiding implicitly in your
honour!&nbsp; I, for my part, have no dislike to you.&nbsp; It is
perfectly natural that you should avail yourself of every means,
presented either by cunning or force, to promote your own
interests.&nbsp; That your principles also should be of the
strictest sort, and your intentions of the most honourable
description,&mdash;these are fancies with which I have nothing to
do; I do not pretend to such strictness myself.&nbsp; Each of us
is free, I to act, and you to think, as seems best.&nbsp; Did I
ever seize you by the throat, to tear out of your body that
valuable soul I so ardently wish to possess?&nbsp; Did I ever set
my servant to attack you, to get back my purse, or attempt to run
off with it from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had not a word to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you detest me,
and I know it; but I bear you no malice on that account.&nbsp; We
must part&mdash;that is clear; also I must say that you begin to
be very tiresome to me.&nbsp; Once more let me advise you to free
yourself entirely from my troublesome presence by the purchase of
your shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I held out the purse to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Schlemihl; not at that price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a deep sigh, I said, &ldquo;Be it so, then; let us part,
I entreat; cross my path no more.&nbsp; There is surely room
enough in the world for us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing, he replied, &ldquo;I go; but just allow me to inform
you how you may at any time recall me whenever you have a mind to
see your most humble servant: you have only to shake your purse,
the sound of the gold will bring me to you in an instant.&nbsp;
In this world every one consults his own advantage; but you see I
have thought of yours, and clearly confer upon you a new
power.&nbsp; Oh this purse! it would still prove a powerful bond
between us, had the moth begun to devour your shadow.&mdash;But
enough: you hold me by my gold, and may command your servant at
any distance.&nbsp; You know that I can be very serviceable to my
friends; and that the rich are my peculiar care&mdash;this you
have observed.&nbsp; As to your shadow, allow me to say, you can
only redeem it on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recollections of former days came over me; and I hastily asked
him if he had obtained Mr. Thomas John&rsquo;s signature.</p>
<p>He smiled, and said, &ldquo;It was by no means necessary from
so excellent a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he? for God&rsquo;s sake tell me: I insist
upon knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With some hesitation, he put his hand into his pocket; and
drew out the altered and pallid form of Mr. John by the hair of
his head, whose livid lips uttered the awful words,
&ldquo;<i>Justo judicio Dei judicatus sum</i>; <i>justo judicio
Dei condemnatus sum</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I am judged and
condemned by the just judgment of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
horror-struck; and instantly throwing the jingling purse into the
abyss, I exclaimed, &ldquo;Wretch! in the name of Heaven, I
conjure you to be gone!&mdash;away from my sight!&mdash;never
appear before me again!&rdquo;&nbsp; With a dark expression on
his countenance, he arose, and immediately vanished behind the
huge rocks which surrounded the place.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> now left equally without gold
and without shadow; but a heavy load was taken from my breast,
and I felt cheerful.&nbsp; Had not my Minna been irrecoverably
lost to me, or even had I been perfectly free from self-reproach
on her account, I felt that happiness might yet have been
mine.&nbsp; At present I was lost in doubt as to my future
course.&nbsp; I examined my pockets, and found I had a few gold
pieces still left, which I counted with feelings of great
satisfaction.&nbsp; I had left my horse at the inn, and was
ashamed to return, or at all events I must wait till the sun had
set, which at present was high in the heavens.&nbsp; I laid
myself down under a shady tree and fell into a peaceful
sleep.</p>
<p>Lovely forms floated in airy measures before me, and filled up
my delightful dreams.&nbsp; Minna, with a garland of flowers
entwined in her hair, was bending over me with a smile of
goodwill; also the worthy Bendel was crowned with flowers, and
hastened to meet me with friendly greetings.&nbsp; Many other
forms seemed to rise up confusedly in the distance: thyself among
the number, Chamisso.&nbsp; Perfect radiance beamed around them,
but none had a shadow; and what was more surprising, there was no
appearance of unhappiness on this account.&nbsp; Nothing was to
be seen or heard but flowers and music; and love and joy, and
groves of never-fading palms, seemed the natives of that happy
clime.</p>
<p>In vain I tried to detain and comprehend the lovely but
fleeting forms.&nbsp; I was conscious, also, of being in a dream,
and was anxious that nothing should rouse me from it; and when I
did awake, I kept my eyes closed, in order if possible to
continue the illusion.&nbsp; At last I opened my eyes.&nbsp; The
sun was now visible in the east; I must have slept the whole
night: I looked upon this as a warning not to return to the
inn.&nbsp; What I had left there I was content to lose, without
much regret; and resigning myself to Providence, I decided on
taking a by-road that led through the wooded declivity of the
mountain.&nbsp; I never once cast a glance behind me; nor did it
ever occur to me to return, as I might have done, to Bendel, whom
I had left in affluence.&nbsp; I reflected on the new character I
was now going to assume in the world.&nbsp; My present garb was
very humble&mdash;consisting of an old black coat I formerly had
worn at Berlin, and which by some chance was the first I put my
hand on before setting out on this journey, a travelling-cap, and
an old pair of boots.&nbsp; I cut down a knotted stick in memory
of the spot, and commenced my pilgrimage.</p>
<p>In the forest I met an aged peasant, who gave me a friendly
greeting, and with whom I entered into conversation, requesting,
as a traveller desirous of information, some particulars relative
to the road, the country, and its inhabitants, the productions of
the mountain, &amp;c.&nbsp; He replied to my various inquiries
with readiness and intelligence.&nbsp; At last we reached the bed
of a mountain-torrent, which had laid waste a considerable tract
of the forest; I inwardly shuddered at the idea of the open
sunshine.&nbsp; I suffered the peasant to go before me.&nbsp; In
the middle of the very place which I dreaded so much, he suddenly
stopped, and turned back to give me an account of this
inundation; but instantly perceiving that I had no shadow, he
broke off abruptly, and exclaimed, &ldquo;How is this?&mdash;you
have no shadow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, alas!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in a long and serious
illness I had the misfortune to lose my hair, my nails, and my
shadow.&nbsp; Look, good father; although my hair has grown
again, it is quite white; and at my age, my nails are still very
short; and my poor shadow seems to have left me, never to
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old man, shaking his head;
&ldquo;no shadow! that was indeed a terrible illness,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not resume his narrative; and at the very first
cross-road we came to, left me without uttering a syllable.&nbsp;
Fresh tears flowed from my eyes, and my cheerfulness had
fled.&nbsp; With a heavy heart I travelled on, avoiding all
society.&nbsp; I plunged into the deepest shades of the forest;
and often, to avoid a sunny tract of country, I waited for hours
till every human being had left it, and I could pass it
unobserved.&nbsp; In the evenings I took shelter in the
villages.&nbsp; I bent my steps to a mine in the mountains, where
I hoped to meet with work underground; for besides that my
present situation compelled me to provide for my own support, I
felt that incessant and laborious occupation alone could divert
my mind from dwelling on painful subjects.&nbsp; A few rainy days
assisted me materially on my journey; but it was to the no small
detriment of my boots, the soles of which were better suited to
Count Peter than to the poor foot-traveller.&nbsp; I was soon
barefoot, and a new purchase must be made.&nbsp; The following
morning I commenced an earnest search in a marketplace, where a
fair was being held; and I saw in one of the booths new and
second-hand boots set out for sale.&nbsp; I was a long time
selecting and bargaining; I wished much to have a new pair, but
was frightened at the extravagant price; and so was obliged to
content myself with a second-hand pair, still pretty good and
strong, which the beautiful fair-haired youth who kept the booth
handed over to me with a cheerful smile, wishing me a prosperous
journey.&nbsp; I went on, and left the place immediately by the
northern gate.</p>
<p>I was so lost in my own thoughts, that I walked along scarcely
knowing how or where.&nbsp; I was calculating the chances of my
reaching the mine by the evening, and considering how I should
introduce myself.&nbsp; I had not gone two hundred steps, when I
perceived I was not in the right road.&nbsp; I looked round, and
found myself in a wild-looking forest of ancient firs, where
apparently the stroke of the axe had never been heard.&nbsp; A
few steps more brought me amid huge rocks covered with moss and
saxifragous plants, between which whole fields of snow and ice
were extended.&nbsp; The air was intensely cold.&nbsp; I looked
round, and the forest had disappeared behind me; a few steps
more, and there was the stillness of death itself.&nbsp; The icy
plain on which I stood stretched to an immeasurable distance, and
a thick cloud rested upon it; the sun was of a red blood-colour
at the verge of the horizon; the cold was insupportable.&nbsp; I
could not imagine what had happened to me.&nbsp; The benumbing
frost made me quicken my pace.&nbsp; I heard a distant sound of
waters; and, at one step more, I stood on the icy shore of some
ocean.&nbsp; Innumerable droves of sea-dogs rushed past me and
plunged into the waves.&nbsp; I continued my way along this
coast, and again met with rocks, plains, birch and fir forests,
and yet only a few minutes had elapsed.&nbsp; It was now
intensely hot.&nbsp; I looked around, and suddenly found myself
between some fertile rice-fields and mulberry-trees; I sat down
under their shade, and found by my watch that it was just one
quarter of an hour since I had left the village market.&nbsp; I
fancied it was a dream; but no, I was indeed awake, as I felt by
the experiment I made of biting my tongue.&nbsp; I closed my eyes
in order to collect my scattered thoughts.&nbsp; Presently I
heard unintelligible words uttered in a nasal tone; and I beheld
two Chinese, whose Asiatic physiognomies were not to be mistaken,
even had their costume not betrayed their origin.&nbsp; They were
addressing me in the language and with the salutations of their
country.&nbsp; I rose, and drew back a couple of steps.&nbsp;
They had disappeared; the landscape was entirely changed; the
rice-fields had given place to trees and woods.&nbsp; I examined
some of the trees and plants around me, and ascertained such of
them as I was acquainted with to be productions of the southern
part of Asia.&nbsp; I made one step towards a particular tree,
and again all was changed.&nbsp; I now moved on like a recruit at
drill, taking slow and measured steps, gazing with astonished
eyes at the wonderful variety of regions, plains, meadows,
mountains, steppes, and sandy deserts, which passed in succession
before me.&nbsp; I had now no doubt that I had seven-leagued
boots on my feet.</p>
<p>I fell on my knees in silent gratitude, shedding tears of
thankfulness; for I now saw clearly what was to be my future
condition.&nbsp; Shut out by early sins from all human society, I
was offered amends for the privation by Nature herself, which I
had ever loved.&nbsp; The earth was granted me as a rich garden;
and the knowledge of her operations was to be the study and
object of my life.&nbsp; This was not a mere resolution.&nbsp; I
have since endeavoured, with anxious and unabated industry,
faithfully to imitate the finished and brilliant model then
presented to me; and my vanity has received a check when led to
compare the picture with the original.&nbsp; I rose immediately,
and took a hasty survey of this new field, where I hoped
afterwards to reap a rich harvest.</p>
<p>I stood on the heights of Thibet; and the sun I had lately
beheld in the east was now sinking in the west.&nbsp; I traversed
Asia from east to west, and thence passed into Africa, which I
curiously examined at repeated visits in all directions.&nbsp; As
I gazed on the ancient pyramids and temples of Egypt, I descried,
in the sandy deserts near Thebes of the hundred gates, the caves
where Christian hermits dwelt of old.</p>
<p>My determination was instantly taken, that here should be my
future dwelling.&nbsp; I chose one of the most secluded, but
roomy, comfortable, and inaccessible to the jackals.</p>
<p>I stepped over from the pillars of Hercules to Europe; and
having taken a survey of its northern and southern countries, I
passed by the north of Asia, on the polar glaciers, to Greenland
and America, visiting both parts of this continent; and the
winter, which was already at its height in the south, drove me
quickly back from Cape Horn to the north.&nbsp; I waited till
daylight had risen in the east of Asia, and then, after a short
rest, continued my pilgrimage.&nbsp; I followed in both the
Americas the vast chain of the Andes, once considered the
loftiest on our globe.&nbsp; I stepped carefully and slowly from
one summit to another, sometimes over snowy heights, sometimes
over flaming volcanoes, often breathless from fatigue.&nbsp; At
last I reached Elias&rsquo;s mountain, and sprang over
Behring&rsquo;s Straits into Asia; I followed the western coast
in its various windings, carefully observing which of the
neighbouring isles was accessible to me.&nbsp; From the peninsula
of Malacca, my boots carried me to Sumatra, Java, Bali, and
Lombok.&nbsp; I made many attempts&mdash;often with danger, and
always unsuccessfully&mdash;to force my way over the numerous
little islands and rocks with which this sea is studded, wishing
to find a north-west passage to Borneo and other islands of the
Archipelago.</p>
<p>At last I sat down at the extreme point of Lombok, my eyes
turned towards the south-east, lamenting that I had so soon
reached the limits allotted to me, and bewailing my fate as a
captive in his grated cell.&nbsp; Thus was I shut out from that
remarkable country, New Holland, and the islands of the southern
ocean, so essentially necessary to a knowledge of the earth, and
which would have best assisted me in the study of the animal and
vegetable kingdoms.&nbsp; And thus, at the very outset, I beheld
all my labours condemned to be limited to mere fragments.</p>
<p>Ah! Chamisso, what is the activity of man?</p>
<p>Frequently in the most rigorous winters of the southern
hemisphere I have rashly thrown myself on a fragment of drifting
ice between Cape Horn and Van Dieman&rsquo;s Land, in the hope of
effecting a passage to New Holland, reckless of the cold and the
vast ocean, reckless of my fate, even should this savage land
prove my grave.</p>
<p>But all in vain&mdash;I never reached New Holland.&nbsp; Each
time, when defeated in my attempt, I returned to Lombok; and
seated at its extreme point, my eyes directed to the south-east,
I gave way afresh to lamentations that my range of investigation
was so limited.&nbsp; At last I tore myself from the spot, and,
heartily grieved at my disappointment, returned to the interior
of Asia.&nbsp; Setting out at morning dawn, I traversed it from
east to west, and at night reached the cave in Thebes which I had
previously selected for my dwelling-place, and had visited
yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>After a short repose, as soon as daylight had visited Europe,
it was my first care to provide myself with the articles of which
I stood most in need.&nbsp; First of all a drag, to act on my
boots; for I had experienced the inconvenience of these whenever
I wished to shorten my steps and examine surrounding objects more
fully.&nbsp; A pair of slippers to go over the boots served the
purpose effectually; and from that time I carried two pairs about
me, because I frequently cast them off from my feet in my
botanical investigations, without having time to pick them up,
when threatened by the approach of lions, men, or hyenas.&nbsp;
My excellent watch, owing to the short duration of my movements,
was also on these occasions an admirable chronometer.&nbsp; I
wanted, besides, a sextant, a few philosophical instruments, and
some books.&nbsp; To purchase these things, I made several
unwilling journeys to London and Paris, choosing a time when I
could be hid by the favouring clouds.&nbsp; As all my ill-gotten
gold was exhausted, I carried over from Africa some ivory, which
is there so plentiful, in payment of my purchases&mdash;taking
care, however, to pick out the smallest teeth, in order not to
over-burden myself.&nbsp; I had thus soon provided myself with
all that I wanted, and now entered on a new mode of life as a
student&mdash;wandering over the globe&mdash;measuring the height
of the mountains, and the temperature of the air and of the
springs&mdash;observing the manners and habits of
animals&mdash;investigating plants and flowers.&nbsp; From the
equator to the pole, and from the new world to the old, I was
constantly engaged in repeating and comparing my experiments.</p>
<p>My usual food consisted of the eggs of the African ostrich or
northern sea-birds, with a few fruits, especially those of the
palm and the banana of the tropics.&nbsp; The tobacco-plant
consoled me when I was depressed; and the affection of my spaniel
was a compensation for the loss of human sympathy and
society.&nbsp; When I returned from my excursions, loaded with
fresh treasures, to my cave in Thebes, which he guarded during my
absence, he ever sprang joyfully forward to greet me, and made me
feel that I was indeed not alone on the earth.&nbsp; An adventure
soon occurred which brought me once more among my
fellow-creatures.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One day, as I was gathering lichens and alg&aelig; on the
northern coast, with the drag on my boots, a bear suddenly made
his appearance, and was stealing towards me round the corner of a
rock.&nbsp; After throwing away my slippers, I attempted to step
across to an island, by means of a rock, projecting from the
waves in the intermediate space, that served as a
stepping-stone.&nbsp; I reached the rock safely with one foot,
but instantly fell into the sea with the other, one of my
slippers having inadvertently remained on.&nbsp; The cold was
intense; and I escaped this imminent peril at the risk of my
life.&nbsp; On coming ashore, I hastened to the Libyan sands to
dry myself in the sun; but the heat affected my head so much,
that, in a fit of illness, I staggered back to the north.&nbsp;
In vain I sought relief by change of place&mdash;hurrying from
east to west, and from west to east&mdash;now in climes of the
south, now in those of the north; sometimes I rushed into
daylight, sometimes into the shades of night.&nbsp; I know not
how long this lasted.&nbsp; A burning fever raged in my veins;
with extreme anguish I felt my senses leaving me.&nbsp; Suddenly,
by an unlucky accident, I trod upon some one&rsquo;s foot, whom I
had hurt, and received a blow in return which laid me
senseless.</p>
<p>On recovering, I found myself lying comfortably in a good bed,
which, with many other beds, stood in a spacious and handsome
apartment.&nbsp; Some one was watching by me; people seemed to be
walking from one bed to another; they came beside me, and spoke
of me as <i>Number Twelve</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the wall, at the
foot of my bed&mdash;it was no dream, for I distinctly read
it&mdash;on a black-marble tablet was inscribed my name, in large
letters of gold:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">PETER SCHLEMIHL</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Underneath were two rows of letters in smaller characters,
which I was too feeble to connect together, and closed my eyes
again.</p>
<p>I now heard something read aloud, in which I distinctly noted
the words, &ldquo;Peter Schlemihl,&rdquo; but could not collect
the full meaning.&nbsp; I saw a man of benevolent aspect, and a
very beautiful female dressed in black, standing near my bed;
their countenances were not unknown to me, but in my weak state I
could not remember who they were.&nbsp; Some time elapsed, and I
began to regain my strength.&nbsp; I was called <i>Number
Twelve</i>, and, from my long beard, was supposed to be a Jew,
but was not the less carefully nursed on that account.&nbsp; No
one seemed to perceive that I was destitute of a shadow.&nbsp; My
boots, I was assured, together with everything found on me when I
was brought here, were in safe keeping, and would be given up to
me on my restoration to health.&nbsp; This place was called the
SCHLMEIHLIUM: the daily recitation I had heard, was an
exhortation to pray for Peter Schlemihl as the founder and
benefactor of this institution.&nbsp; The benevolent-looking man
whom I had seen by my bedside was Bendel; the beautiful lady in
black was Minna.</p>
<p>I had been enjoying the advantages of the Schlemihlium without
being recognised; and I learned, further, that I was in
Bendel&rsquo;s native town, where he had employed a part of my
once unhallowed gold in founding an hospital in my name, under
his superintendence, and that its unfortunate inmates daily
pronounced blessings on me.&nbsp; Minna had become a widow: an
unhappy lawsuit had deprived Rascal of his life, and Minna of the
greater part of her property.&nbsp; Her parents were no more; and
here she dwelt in widowed piety, wholly devoting herself to works
of mercy.</p>
<p>One day, as she stood by the side of Number Twelve&rsquo;s bed
with Bendel, he said to her, &ldquo;Noble lady, why expose
yourself so frequently to this unhealthy atmosphere?&nbsp; Has
fate dealt so harshly with you as to render you desirous of
death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, Mr. Bendel,&rdquo; she replied;
&ldquo;since I have awoke from my long dream, all has gone well
with me.&nbsp; I now neither wish for death nor fear it, and
think on the future and on the past with equal serenity.&nbsp; Do
you not also feel an inward satisfaction in thus paying a pious
tribute of gratitude and love to your old master and
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks be to God, I do, noble lady,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, how wonderfully has everything fallen
out!&nbsp; How thoughtlessly have we sipped joys and sorrows from
the full cup now drained to the last drop; and we might fancy the
past a mere prelude to the real scene for which we now wait armed
by experience.&nbsp; How different has been the reality!&nbsp;
Yet let us not regret the past, but rather rejoice that we have
not lived in vain.&nbsp; As respects our old friend also, I have
a firm hope that it is now better with him than
formerly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust so, too,&rdquo; answered Minna; and so saying
she passed by me, and they departed.</p>
<p>This conversation made a deep impression on me; and I
hesitated whether I should discover myself or depart
unknown.&nbsp; At last I decided; and, asking for pen and paper,
wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matters are indeed better with your old friend than
formerly.&nbsp; He has repented; and his repentance has led to
forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now attempted to rise, for I felt myself stronger.&nbsp; The
keys of a little chest near my bed were given me; and in it I
found all my effects.&nbsp; I put on my clothes; fastened my
botanical case round me&mdash;wherein, with delight, I found my
northern lichens all safe&mdash;put on my boots, and leaving my
note on the table, left the gates, and was speedily far advanced
on the road to Thebes.</p>
<p>Passing along the Syrian coast, which was the same road I had
taken on last leaving home, I beheld my poor Figaro running to
meet me.&nbsp; The faithful animal, after vainly waiting at home
for his master&rsquo;s return, had probably followed his
traces.&nbsp; I stood still, and called him.&nbsp; He sprang
towards me with leaps and barks, and a thousand demonstrations of
unaffected delight.&nbsp; I took him in my arms&mdash;for he was
unable to follow me&mdash;and carried him home.</p>
<p>There I found everything exactly in the order in which I had
left it; and returned by degrees, as my increasing strength
allowed me, to my old occupations and usual mode of life, from
which I was kept back a whole year by my fall into the Polar
Ocean.&nbsp; And this, dear Chamisso, is the life I am still
leading.&nbsp; My boots are not yet worn out, as I had been led
to fear would be the case from that very learned work of
Tieckius&mdash;<i>De rebus gestis Pollicilli</i>.&nbsp; Their
energies remain unimpaired; and although mine are gradually
failing me, I enjoy the consolation of having spent them in
pursuing incessantly one object, and that not fruitlessly.</p>
<p>So far as my boots would carry me, I have observed and studied
our globe and its conformation, its mountains and temperature,
the atmosphere in its various changes, the influences of the
magnetic power; in fact, I have studied all living
creation&mdash;and more especially the kingdom of
plants&mdash;more profoundly than any one of our race.&nbsp; I
have arranged all the facts in proper order, to the best of my
ability, in different works.&nbsp; The consequences deducible
from these facts, and my views respecting them, I have hastily
recorded in some essays and dissertations.&nbsp; I have settled
the geography of the interior of Africa and the Arctic regions,
of the interior of Asia and of its eastern coast.&nbsp; My
<i>Historia stirpium plantarum utriusque orbis</i> is an
extensive fragment of a <i>Flora universalis terr&aelig;</i> and
a part of my <i>Systema natur&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; Besides
increasing the number of our known species by more than a third,
I have also contributed somewhat to the natural system of plants
and to a knowledge of their geography.&nbsp; I am now deeply
engaged on my <i>Fauna</i>, and shall take care to have my
manuscripts sent to the University of Berlin before my
decease.</p>
<p>I have selected thee, my dear Chamisso, to be the guardian of
my wonderful history, thinking that, when I have left this world,
it may afford valuable instruction to the living.&nbsp; As for
thee, Chamisso, if thou wouldst live amongst thy
fellow-creatures, learn to value thy shadow more than gold; if
thou wouldst only live to thyself and thy nobler part&mdash;in
this thou needest no counsel.</p>
<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>From the prefatory matter
prefixed to time Berlin edition</i>, 1839, <i>from which the
present translation is made</i>.]</p>
<h4>PREFACE BY THE EDITOR.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> origin of &ldquo;Peter
Schlemihl&rdquo; is to be ascribed in a great degree to
circumstances that occurred in the life of the writer.&nbsp;
During the eventful year of 1813, when the movement broke out
which ultimately freed Germany from the yoke of her oppressor,
and precipitated his downfall, Chamisso was in Berlin.&nbsp;
Everyone who could wield a sword hastened then to employ it on
behalf of Germany and of the good cause.&nbsp; Chamisso had not
only a powerful arm, but a heart also of truly German mould; and
yet he was placed in a situation so peculiar as to isolate him
among millions.&nbsp; As he was of French parentage, the question
was, not merely whether he should fight on behalf of Germany,
but, also, whether he should fight against the people with whom
he was connected by the ties of blood and family
relationship.&nbsp; Hence arose a struggle in his breast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I, and I alone, am forbidden at this juncture to wield a
sword!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was frequently his exclamation; and
instead of meeting with sympathy on account of his peculiar
situation, he was frequently doomed to hear, in the capital of
Prussia, the head-quarters of the confederation against France
and Napoleon, expressions of hatred and scorn directed against
his countrymen.&nbsp; He was himself too equitable to mistake the
cause of such expressions, which were perfectly natural under the
circumstances, but they nevertheless deeply afflicted him when
they reached his ears.&nbsp; In this state of things his friends
resolved to remove him from such a scene of excitement, and to
place him amid the quiet scenery of the country.&nbsp; An asylum
was offered him in the family of Count Itzenplitsch, where he was
sufficiently near to become acquainted with the gradual
development of the all-important crisis, and yet free from any
unpleasant personal contact with it.&nbsp; Here, at the
family-seat of Cunersdorf, scarcely a day&rsquo;s journey from
Berlin, wholly devoted to botany and other favourite pursuits,
Chamisso conceived the idea of &ldquo;Peter Schlemihl,&rdquo; and
with rapid pen finished off the story.&nbsp; Chamisso&rsquo;s
letters of this date (in the first volume of his Life, by the
writer of this notice) afford evidence of this.</p>
<p>The first edition of the incomparable story appeared in 1814,
with a dedication dated May 27, 1813; and it was just beginning
to be known in the world at the commencement of 1815, when the
author left Germany on a voyage round the world, of which the
story contains a remarkable anticipation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peter
Schlemihl&rdquo; was his parting salutation to his second
fatherland, and the first foundation-stone of his future
fame.</p>
<p>Chamisso was often pestered with questions respecting what he
really meant by the story of Schlemihl.&nbsp; These questions
amused as well as annoyed him.&nbsp; The truth is, that his
intention in writing it was perhaps scarcely of so precise a
nature as to admit of his giving a formal account of it.&nbsp;
The story sprang into being of itself, like every work of genius,
prompted by a self-creating power.&nbsp; In a letter to the
writer of this notice, after he had just commenced the story, he
says, &ldquo;A book was the last thing you would have expected
from me!&nbsp; Place it before your wife this evening, if you
have time; should she be desirous to know Schlemihl&rsquo;s
further adventures, and particularly who the man in the grey
cloak is&mdash;send me back the MS. immediately, that I may
continue the story; but if you do not return it, I shall know the
meaning of the signal perfectly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it possible for
any writer to submit himself to the scrutiny of the public more
good-naturedly?</p>
<p>In the preface to the new French translation (which appeared
in 1838) of this story, Chamisso amuses himself in his own
peculiar way, over the prying curiosity of those who want to know
what his real object was in writing this tale:&mdash;&ldquo;The
present story,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;has fallen into the hands
of thoughtful people, who, being accustomed to read only for
instruction&rsquo;s sake, have been at a loss to know what the
shadow signifies.&nbsp; On this point several have formed curious
hypotheses; others, who do me the honour to believe that I am
more learned than I really am, have addressed themselves to me
for the solution of their doubts.&nbsp; The questions with which
they have besieged me have made me blush on account of my
ignorance.&nbsp; I have therefore been induced to devote myself
to the investigation of a matter not hitherto the subject of my
studies; and I now beg to submit to the world the result of my
learned researches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Concerning Shadows</i>.&mdash;A dark body can
only be partially illuminated by a bright one.&nbsp; The dark
space which lies in the direction of the unilluminated part is
what we call a <i>shadow</i>.&nbsp; Properly speaking, shadow
signifies a bodily space, the form of which depends upon the form
of the illuminating body, and upon their opposite position with
regard to each other.&nbsp; The shadow thrown on a surface,
situated before the shadow-projecting body, is, therefore,
nothing else than the intersection of this surface by the bodily
space (in French, <i>le solide</i>, on which word <i>solid</i>
the whole force of the humour turns), which we before designated
by the word shadow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question in this wonderful history of Peter
Schlemihl relates entirely to the last-mentioned quality,
<i>solidity</i>.&nbsp; The science of finance instructs us
sufficiently as to the value of money: the value of a shadow is
less generally acknowledged.&nbsp; My thoughtless friend was
covetous of money, of which he knew the value, and forgot to
think on solid substance.&nbsp; It was his wish that the lesson
which he had paid for so dearly should be turned to our profit;
and his bitter experience calls to us with a loud voice, Think on
the solid&mdash;the substantial!&rdquo;&nbsp; So far
Chamisso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Schlemihl&rdquo; has been translated into almost
all the languages of Europe.&nbsp; Of the Dutch, Spanish, and
Russian translations we do not possess any copies.&nbsp; The
French and Italian are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Pierre Schlemihl</i>.&nbsp; <i>Paris</i>,
<i>chez Ladvocat</i>, 1822.&mdash;This was revised by Chamisso in
manuscript, who added a preface to it; but the translation was
afterwards capriciously altered by the same publisher.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Un Roman du Po&egrave;te Allemand
contemporain</i>, <i>Adelbert de Chamisso</i>; <i>traduit par N.
Martin</i>.&nbsp; <i>Histoire merveilleuse de Pierre
Schlemihl</i>.&nbsp; <i>Dunquerque</i>, 1837.&mdash;At the end
the translator has added a letter to a friend, with the Greek
motto, &ldquo;Life is the dream of a shadow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
translator, while laughing in this letter at the Germans, who, he
says, ought to write three folio volumes of explanatory notes on
the little volume, falls into the error of being very diffuse
himself in the attempt to elucidate his author.&nbsp; His long
letter concludes not inappropriately with these words: &ldquo;I
have just observed, although certainly rather late, that I have
written a letter full of shadows, and instead of lighting a torch
to illuminate the darkness, have, I fear, only deepened the
gloom.&nbsp; Should this be the case, the reader at any rate will
not withhold from me the praise of having preserved the colours
of the original.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Merveilleuse Histoire de Pierre

<i>Dono di simpatia al gentil sesso</i>.&nbsp; <i>Milano</i>,

Engravings.&mdash;The editor is pleased not only to withhold the
author&rsquo;s name, but manages so to word his own preface as to
lead his readers to conclude that he himself is the author of the
book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schlemihl&rdquo; was also brought on the stage, but
without giving the honours of authorship to the true
source.&nbsp; This took place at Vienna, in February, 1819.&nbsp;
The announcement ran thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Pulzlivizli, or the Man
without a Shadow: a comic, enchanted drama, in three acts,
adapted from De la Motte Fouqu&eacute;, by Ferdinand
Rosenau.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the characters were the grey man, and
a certain Albert, probably intended for Schlemihl.&nbsp; Of the
contents of the piece we know nothing.</p>
<p>In England two editions have appeared [previous to the
present,&mdash;<i>Tr.</i>]; one of which was reprinted at Boston
in 1825.&nbsp; Of the popularity of &ldquo;Peter Schlemihl&rdquo;
in Great Britain we have a striking proof, from a caricature that
appeared shortly after the coronation of William IV.&nbsp; On the
celebration of this solemnity, a brother of the King&mdash;the
Duke of Cumberland&mdash;arrived from the Continent to be present
on the occasion; and as he was well known to be an ardent Tory,
his reception on the part of the people was not of the most
flattering description.&nbsp; As a consequence of this, and
owing, perhaps, to an expression that fell from the Duke, that
&ldquo;popularity is only a shadow,&rdquo; the caricature made
its appearance.&nbsp; In the foreground of the print is seen a
striking likeness of the royal Duke in the costume of the Order
of the Garter.&nbsp; On his right stands the King, with the crown
on his head, and reflecting a goodly shadow on the wall.&nbsp;
Between the King and his brother are some courtiers, who exclaim,
in a tone of commiseration, &ldquo;Lost, or stolen, a
gentleman&rsquo;s shadow.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the bottom of the print
is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">&ldquo;PETER SCHLEMIHL AT THE
CORONATION.</span></p>
<p>Granted that popularity is nothing but a shadow, it is still
far from pleasant to be without that shadow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>BRIEF SKETCH OF CHAMISSO&rsquo;S LIFE.</h3>
<p>Louis Adelbert de Chamisso was born January 27, 1781, at
Beaucourt, in Champagne.&nbsp; At the Revolution, he left France
with his parents, and came to Berlin, where, in 1796, he was
appointed page to the King, and soon after had a commission given
him in the army.&nbsp; He applied himself with much ardour to
acquire the German language, and felt great interest in the study
of its literature, particularly its poetry and philosophy, and
was most attracted by those writers whose character presented the
greatest contrast to that of his own countrymen.&nbsp; By
intercourse with the learned, and by the friendships which he
formed, he soon became thoroughly German, which he proved by his
poems, which were distinguished above the crowd of such
compositions by the originality of their style, and peculiar
vigour.&nbsp; From 1804 to 1806 he published the &ldquo;Almanack
of the Muses,&rdquo; in conjunction with Varnhagen von
Ense.&nbsp; At the peace of Tilsit he left the army, and visited
France, when his family obtained back part of their
possessions.&nbsp; At this time he held, for a short period, a
situation as Professor at the school of Napoleonville, but soon
returned to Germany, devoting himself wholly to a literary life,
and in particular to the study of natural history.&nbsp; During
his visit to France, he spent some time with Madame de
Sta&euml;l, whom he also visited in Switzerland.&nbsp; In 1811 he
returned to Berlin; and in 1813 he wrote his &ldquo;Peter
Schlemihl,&rdquo; which marked him out as a man of distinguished
and original genius.&nbsp; It was published in 1814 by his friend
Fouqu&eacute;.&nbsp; When Count Runnjanzow resolved on
undertaking a voyage round the world, he invited Chamisso to
accompany him as naturalist to the expedition&mdash;an invitation
which he gladly embraced.&nbsp; The ships left Cronstadt in 1815,
and returned in 1818; and although the discovery of a North-West
passage&mdash;the great object of the expedition&mdash;was not
attained, yet extensive acquisitions were made in every
department of scientific research.&nbsp; Chamisso&rsquo;s share
in the voyage is recorded in the third volume of the account of
it published at Weimar in 1821, and does honour to his spirit of
careful observation and his accuracy.&nbsp; He now again fixed
his residence at Berlin, from whose university he received the
degree of doctor in philosophy.&nbsp; An appointment at the
Botanic Garden allowed him full liberty to follow up his
favourite pursuit of natural history, and bound him by still
stronger ties to his second fatherland.&nbsp; He now wrote an
account of the principal plants of the North of Germany, with
views respecting the vegetable kingdom and the science of botany:
this work appeared at Berlin in 1827.&nbsp; Poetry, however, had
still some share of his attention; and he continued, during the
latter years of his life, to maintain his claims to an honourable
place among the poets of Germany.&nbsp; Several of his ballads
and romances rank with the most distinguished of modern times in
this branch of composition.&nbsp; Surrounded by a circle of
attached and admiring friends, Chamisso continued thus entirely
engaged till his death, in 1839, leaving behind him a name and
works which posterity &ldquo;will not willingly let
perish.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>FROM THE BARON DE LA MOTTE FOUQU&Eacute; TO JULIUS EDWARD
HITZIG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>From the first
edition</i>.]</p>
<p>We should take care, my dear Edward, not to expose the history
of poor Schlemihl to eyes unfit to look upon it.&nbsp; That would
be a bad experiment.&nbsp; Of such eyes there are plenty; and who
is able to predict what may befal a <i>manuscript</i>, which is
almost more difficult to guard than spoken language?&nbsp; Like a
person seized with vertigo, therefore, who, in the paroxysm of
his feelings, leaps into the abyss, I commit the story to the
press.</p>
<p>And yet there are better and more serious reasons for the step
I have taken.&nbsp; If I am not wholly deceived, there are in our
dear Germany many hearts both capable and worthy of comprehending
poor Schlemihl, although a smile will arise on the countenance of
many among our honest countrymen at the bitter sport which was
death to him and to the innocent being whom he drew along with
him.&nbsp; And you, Edward, when you have seen the estimable
work, and reflected on the number of unknown and sympathising
bosoms who, with ourselves, will learn to love it,&mdash;you
will, then, perhaps, feel that some drops of consolation have
been instilled into those wounds inflicted on you, and on all who
love you, by death.</p>
<p>To conclude: I have become convinced, by repeated experience,
that a guardian angel watches over books, places them in proper
hands, and if not always, yet often, prevents them from falling
into improper.&nbsp; In any case, he exercises an invisible
guardianship over every work of true genius and genuine feeling,
and with unfailing tact and skill opens or shuts its pages as he
sees fit.</p>
<p>To this guardian angel I commit our
&ldquo;Schlemihl.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so, adieu!</p>

<h2>THE STORY WITHOUT AN END.</h2>
<h3>TO MY DAUGHTER</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Child</span>,</p>
<p>The story you love so much in German I dedicate to you in
English.&nbsp; It was in compliance with your earnest wish that
other children might share the delight it has so often afforded
you, that I translated it; so that it is, in some sort, yours of
right.&nbsp; Let us hope that your confident expectations of
sympathy in your pleasure may not be disappointed; or that, if
others think the story less beautiful than you do, they may find
compensation in the graceful designs it has inspired.</p>
<p>You have often regretted that it left off so soon, and would,
I believe, &ldquo;have been glad to hear more and more, and for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; The continuation you have longed for lies in a
wide and magnificent book, which contains more wonderful and
glorious things than all our favourite fairy tales put
together.&nbsp; But to read in that book, so as to discover all
its beautiful meanings, you must have pure, clear eyes, and an
humble, loving heart; otherwise you will complain, as some do,
that it is dim and puzzling; or, as others that it is dull and
monotonous.</p>
<p>May you continue to read in it with new curiosity, new
delight, and new profit; and to find it, as long as you live, the
untiring &ldquo;Story without an End.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your affectionate mother,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">S. A.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a Child who lived in
a little hut, and in the hut there was nothing but a little bed
and a looking-glass which hung in a dark corner.&nbsp; Now the
Child cared nothing at all about the looking-glass; but as soon
as the first sunbeam glided softly through the casement, and
kissed his sweet eyelids, and the finch and the linnet waked him
merrily with their morning songs, he arose, and went out into the
green meadow.&nbsp; And he begged flour of the primrose, and
sugar of the violet, and butter of the buttercup; he shook
dewdrops from the cowslip into the cup of a harebell; spread out
a large lime-leaf, set his little breakfast upon it, and feasted
daintily.&nbsp; Sometimes he invited a humming-bee, oftener a gay
butterfly, to partake his feast; but his favourite guest was the
blue dragon-fly.&nbsp; The bee murmured a good deal, in a solemn
tone, about his riches; but the Child thought that if he were a
bee, heaps of treasure would not make him gay and happy; and that
it must be much more delightful and glorious to float about in
the free and fresh breezes of spring, and to hum joyously in the
web of the sunbeams, than, with heavy feet and heavy heart, to
stow the silver wax and the golden honey into cells.</p>
<p>To this the Butterfly assented; and he told how once on a
time, he too had been greedy and sordid; how he had thought of
nothing but eating, and had never once turned his eyes upwards to
the blue heavens.&nbsp; At length, however, a complete change had
come over him; and instead of crawling spiritless about the dirty
earth, half dreaming, he all at once awaked as out of a deep
sleep.&nbsp; And now he would rise into the air;&mdash;and it was
his greatest joy sometimes to play with the light, and to reflect
the heavens in the bright eyes of his wings; sometimes to listen
to the soft language of the flowers, and catch their
secrets.&nbsp; Such talk delighted the Child, and his breakfast
was the sweeter to him, and the sunshine on leaf and flower
seemed to him more bright and cheering.</p>
<p>But when the Bee had flown off to beg from flower to flower,
and the Butterfly had fluttered away to his playfellows, the
Dragon-fly still remained, poised on a blade of grass.&nbsp; Her
slender and burnished body, more brightly and deeply blue than
the deep blue sky, glistened in the sun beam; and her net-like
wings laughed at the flowers because <i>they</i> could not fly,
but must stand still and abide the wind and the rain.&nbsp; The
Dragon-fly sipped a little of the Child&rsquo;s clear dew-drops
and blue violet-honey, and then whispered her winged words.&nbsp;
And the Child made an end of his repast, closed his dark blue
eyes, bent down his beautiful head, and listened to the sweet
prattle.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Then the Dragon-fly told much of the merry life in the green
wood; how sometimes she played hide-and-seek with her playfellows
under the broad leaves of the oak and the beech trees; or
hunt-the-hare along the surface of the still waters; sometimes
quietly watched the sunbeams, as they flew busily from moss to
flower and from flower to bush, and shed life and warmth over
all.&nbsp; But at night, she said, the moonbeams glided softly
around the wood, and dropped dew into the mouths of all the
thirsty plants; and when the dawn pelted the slumberers with the
soft roses of heaven, some of the half-drunken flowers looked up
and smiled; but most of them could not so much as raise their
heads for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Such stories did the Dragon-fly tell; and as the Child sat
motionless with his eyes shut, and his head rested on his little
hand, she thought he had fallen asleep; so she poised her double
wings and flew into the rustling wood.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the Child was only sunk into a
dream of delight, and was wishing <i>he</i> were a sunbeam or a
moonbeam; and he would have been glad to hear more and more, and
for ever.&nbsp; But at last, as all was still, he opened his eyes
and looked around for his dear guest; but she was flown far away;
so he could not bear to sit there any longer alone, and he rose
and went to the gurgling brook.&nbsp; It gushed and rolled so
merrily, and tumbled so wildly along as it hurried to throw
itself head over heels into the river, just as if the great massy
rock out of which it sprang were close behind it, and could only
be escaped by a break-neck leap.</p>
<p>Then the Child began to talk to the little waves, and asked
them whence they came.&nbsp; They would not stay to give him an
answer, but danced away, one over another; till at last, that the
sweet Child might not be grieved, a drop of water stopped behind
a piece of rock.&nbsp; From her the Child heard strange
histories, but he could not understand them all, for she told him
about her former life, and about the depths of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long while ago,&rdquo; said the Drop of Water,
&ldquo;I lived with my countless sisters in the great ocean, in
peace and unity.&nbsp; We had all sorts of pastimes; sometimes we
mounted up high into the air, and peeped at the stars; then we
sank plump down deep below, and looked how the coral builders
work till they are tired, that they may reach the light of day at
last.&nbsp; But I was conceited, and thought myself much better
than my sisters.&nbsp; And so one day, when the sun rose out of
the sea, I clung fast to one of his hot beams, and thought that
now I should reach the stars, and become one of them.&nbsp; But I
had not ascended far, when the sunbeam shook me off, and in spite
of all I could say or do, let me fall into a dark cloud.&nbsp;
And soon a flash of fire darted through the cloud, and now I
thought I must surely die; but the whole cloud laid itself down
softly upon the top of a mountain, and so I escaped with my
fright, and a black eye.&nbsp; Now I thought I should remain
hidden, when all on a sudden I slipped over a round pebble, fell
from one stone to another, down into the depths of the mountain,
till at last it was pitch dark, and I could neither see nor hear
anything.&nbsp; Then I found, indeed, that &lsquo;pride goeth
before a fall,&rsquo; resigned myself to my fate, and, as I had
already laid aside all my unhappy pride in the cloud, my portion
was now the salt of humility; and after undergoing many
purifications from the hidden virtues of metals and minerals, I
was at length permitted to come up once more into the free
cheerful air; and now will I run back to my sisters, and there
wait patiently till I am called to something better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But hardly had she done when the root of a forget-me-not
caught the drop of water by her hair and sucked her in, that she
might become a floweret, and twinkle brightly as a blue star on
the green firmament of earth.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Child did not very well know
what to think of all this: he went thoughtfully home and laid
himself on his little bed; and all night long he was wandering
about on the ocean, and among the stars, and over the dark
mountain.&nbsp; But the moon loved to look on the slumbering
Child as he lay with his little head softly pillowed on his right
arm.&nbsp; She lingered a long time before his little window, and
went slowly away to lighten the dark chamber of some sick
person.</p>
<p>As the moon&rsquo;s soft light lay on the Child&rsquo;s
eyelids, he fancied he sat in a golden boat, on a great, great
water; countless stars swam glittering on the dark mirror.&nbsp;
He stretched out his hand to catch the nearest star, but it had
vanished, and the water sprayed up against him.&nbsp; Then he saw
clearly that these were not the real stars; he looked up to
heaven, and wished he could fly thither.</p>
<p>But in the meantime the moon had wandered on her way; and now
the Child was led in his dream into the clouds, and he thought he
was sitting on a white sheep, and he saw many lambs grazing
around him.&nbsp; He tried to catch a little lamb to play with,
but it was all mist and vapour; and the Child was sorrowful, and
wished himself down again in his own meadow, where his own lamb
was sporting gaily about.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the moon was gone to sleep behind the mountains, and
all around was dark.&nbsp; Then the Child dreamt that he fell
down into the dark, gloomy caverns of the mountain, and at that
he was so frightened, that he suddenly awoke, just as morning
opened her clear eye over the nearest hill.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Child started up, and, to
recover himself from his fright, went into the little
flower-garden behind his cottage, where the beds were surrounded
by ancient palm-trees, and where he knew that all the flowers
would nod kindly at him.&nbsp; But, behold, the Tulip turned up
her nose, and the Ranunculus held her head as stiffly as
possible, that she might not bow good-morrow to him.&nbsp; The
Rose, with her fair round cheeks, smiled and greeted the Child
lovingly; so he went up to her and kissed her fragrant
mouth.&nbsp; And then the Rose tenderly complained that he so
seldom came into the garden, and that she gave out her bloom and
her fragrance the live-long day in vain; for the other flowers
could not see her, because they were too low, or did not care to
look at her, because they themselves were so rich in bloom and
fragrance.&nbsp; But she was most delighted when she glowed in
the blooming head of a child, and could pour out all her
heart&rsquo;s secrets to him in sweet odours.&nbsp; Among other
things, the Rose whispered in his ear that she was the fulness of
beauty.</p>
<p>And in truth the Child, while looking at her beauty, seemed to
have quite forgotten to go on; till the Blue Larkspur called to
him, and asked whether he cared nothing more about his faithful
friend; she said that she was unchanged, and that even in death
she should look upon him with eyes of unfading blue.</p>
<p>The Child thanked her for her true-heartedness, and passed on
to the Hyacinth, who stood near the puffy, full-cheeked, gaudy
Tulips.&nbsp; Even from a distance the Hyacinth sent forth kisses
to him, for she knew not how to express her love.&nbsp; Although
she was not remarkable for her beauty, yet the Child felt himself
wondrously attracted by her, for he thought no flower loved him
so well.&nbsp; But the Hyacinth poured out her full heart and
wept bitterly, because she stood so lonely; the Tulips indeed
were her countrymen, but they were so cold and unfeeling that she
was ashamed of them.&nbsp; The Child encouraged her, and told her
he did not think things were so bad as she fancied.&nbsp; The
Tulips spoke their love in bright looks, while she uttered hers
in fragrant words; that these, indeed, were lovelier and more
intelligible, but that the others were not to be despised.</p>
<p>Then the Hyacinth was comforted, and said she would be
content; and the Child went on to the powdered Auricula, who, in
her bashfulness, looked kindly up to him, and would gladly have
given him more than kind looks, had she had more to give.&nbsp;
But the Child was satisfied with her modest greeting; he felt
that he was poor too, and he saw the deep, thoughtful colours
that lay beneath her golden dust.&nbsp; But the humble flower, of
her own accord, sent him to her neighbour, the Lily, whom she
willingly acknowledged as her queen.&nbsp; And when the Child
came to the Lily, the slender flower waved to and fro and bowed
her pale head with gentle pride and stately modesty, and sent
forth a fragrant greeting to him.&nbsp; The Child knew not what
had come to him: it reached his inmost heart, so that his eyes
filled with soft tears.&nbsp; Then he marked how the lily gazed
with a clear and steadfast eye upon the sun, and how the sun
looked down again into her pure chalice, and how, amid this
interchange of looks, the three golden threads united in the
centre.&nbsp; And the Child heard how one scarlet Lady-bird at
the bottom of the cup said to another, &ldquo;Knowest thou not
that we dwell in the flower of heaven?&rdquo; and the other
replied, &ldquo;Yes; and now will the mystery be
fulfilled.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as the Child saw and heard all this,
the dim image of his unknown parents, as it were veiled in a holy
light, floated before his eyes: he strove to grasp it, but the
light was gone, and the Child slipped, and would have fallen, had
not the branch of a currant bush caught and held him; and he took
some of the bright berries for his morning&rsquo;s meal, and went
back to his hut and stripped the little branches.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> in the hut he stayed not long,
all was so gloomy, close, and silent within, and abroad
everything seemed to smile, and to exult in the clear and
unbounded space.&nbsp; Therefore the Child went out into the
green wood, of which the Dragon-fly had told him such pleasant
stories.&nbsp; But he found everything far more beautiful and
lovely even than she had described it; for all about, wherever he
went, the tender moss pressed his little feet, and the delicate
grass embraced his knees, and the flowers kissed his hands, and
even the branches stroked his cheeks with a kind and refreshing
touch, and the high trees threw their fragrant shade around
him.</p>
<p>There was no end to his delight.&nbsp; The little birds
warbled and sang, and fluttered and hopped about, and the
delicate wood-flowers gave out their beauty and their odours; and
every sweet sound took a sweet odour by the hand, and thus walked
through the open door of the Child&rsquo;s heart, and held a
joyous nuptial dance therein.&nbsp; But the Nightingale and the
Lily of the Valley led the dance; for the Nightingale sang of
nought but love, and the Lily breathed of nought but innocence,
and he was the bridegroom and she was the bride.&nbsp; And the
Nightingale was never weary of repeating the same thing a hundred
times over, for the spring of love which gushed from his heart
was ever new&mdash;and the Lily bowed her head bashfully, that no
one might see her glowing heart.&nbsp; And yet the one lived so
solely and entirely in the other, that no one could see whether
the notes of the Nightingale were floating lilies, or the lilies
visible notes, falling like dewdrops from the Nightingale&rsquo;s
throat.</p>
<p>The Child&rsquo;s heart was full of joy even to the
brim.&nbsp; He set himself down, and he almost thought he should
like to take root there, and live for ever among the sweet plants
and flowers, and so become a true sharer in all their gentle
pleasures.&nbsp; For he felt a deep delight in the still,
secluded, twilight existence of the mosses and small herbs, which
felt not the storm, nor the frost, nor the scorching sunbeam; but
dwelt quietly among their many friends and neighbours, feasting
in peace and good fellowship on the dew and cool shadows which
the mighty trees shed upon them.&nbsp; To them it was a high
festival when a sunbeam chanced to visit their lowly home; whilst
the tops of the lofty trees could find joy and beauty only in the
purple rays of morning or evening.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> as the Child sat there, a
little Mouse rustled from among the dry leaves of the former
year, and a Lizard half glided from a crevice in the rock, and
both of them fixed their bright eyes upon the little stranger;
and when they saw that he designed them no evil, they took
courage and came nearer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to live with you,&rdquo; said the Child
to the two little creatures, in a soft, subdued voice, that he
might not frighten them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your chambers are so snug,
so warm, and yet so shaded, and the flowers grow in at your
windows, and the birds sing you their morning song, and call you
to table and to bed with their clear warblings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Mouse, &ldquo;it would be all very
well if all the plants bore nuts and mast, instead of those silly
flowers; and if I were not obliged to grub under ground in the
spring, and gnaw the bitter roots, whilst they are dressing
themselves in their fine flowers and flaunting it to the world,
as if they had endless stores of honey in their
cellars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; interrupted the Lizard,
pertly; &ldquo;do you think, because you are grey, that other
people must throw away their handsome clothes, or let them lie in
the dark wardrobe under ground, and wear nothing but grey
too?&nbsp; I am not so envious.&nbsp; The flowers may dress
themselves as they like for me; they pay for it out of their own
pockets, and they feed bees and beetles from their cups; but what
I want to know is, of what use are birds in the world?&nbsp; Such
a fluttering and chattering, truly, from morning early to evening
late, that one is worried and stunned to death, and there is
never a day&rsquo;s peace for them.&nbsp; And they do nothing;
only snap up the flies and the spiders out of the mouths of such
as I.&nbsp; For my part, I should be perfectly satisfied,
provided all the birds in the world were flies and
beetles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Child changed colour, and his heart was sick and saddened
when he heard their evil tongues.&nbsp; He could not imagine how
anybody could speak ill of the beautiful flowers, or scoff at his
beloved birds.&nbsp; He was waked out of a sweet dream, and the
wood seemed to him lonely and desert, and he was ill at
ease.&nbsp; He started up hastily, so that the Mouse and the
Lizard shrank back alarmed, and did not look around them till
they thought themselves safe out of the reach of the stranger
with the large, severe eyes.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the Child went away from the
place; and as he hung down his head thoughtfully, he did not
observe that he took the wrong path, nor see how the flowers on
either side bowed their heads to welcome him, nor hear how the
old birds from the boughs, and the young from the nests, cried
aloud to him, &ldquo;God bless thee, our dear little
prince!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he went on and on, farther and farther,
into the deep wood; and he thought over the foolish and heartless
talk of the two selfish chatterers, and could not understand
it.&nbsp; He would fain have forgotten it, but he could
not.&nbsp; And the more he pondered, the more it seemed to him as
if a malicious spider had spun her web around him, and as if his
eyes were weary with trying to look through it.</p>
<p>And suddenly he came to a still water, above which young
beeches lovingly entwined their arms.&nbsp; He looked in the
water, and his eyes were riveted to it as if by
enchantment.&nbsp; He could not move, but stood and gazed in the
soft, placid mirror, from the bosom of which the tender green
foliage, with the deep blue heavens between, gleamed so
wondrously upon him.&nbsp; His sorrow was all forgotten, and even
the echo of the discord in his little heart was hushed.&nbsp;
That heart was once more in his eyes; and fain would he have
drunk in the soft beauty of the colours that lay beneath him, or
have plunged into the lovely deep.</p>
<p>Then the breeze began to sigh among the treetops.&nbsp; The
Child raised his eyes and saw overhead the quivering green, and
the deep blue behind it, and he knew not whether he were waking
or dreaming: which were the real leaves and the real
heaven&mdash;those in the depths above or in the depths
beneath?&nbsp; Long did the Child waver, and his thoughts floated
in a delicious dreaminess from one to the other, till the
Dragon-fly flew to him in affectionate haste, and with rustling
wings greeted her kind host.&nbsp; The Child returned her
greeting, and was glad to meet an acquaintance with whom he could
share the rich feast of his joy.&nbsp; But first he asked the
Dragon-fly if she could decide for him between the Upper and the
Nether&mdash;the height and the depth?&nbsp; The Dragon-fly flew
above, and beneath, and around; but the Water
spake:&mdash;&ldquo;The foliage and the sky above are not the
true ones: the leaves wither and fall; the sky is often overcast,
and sometimes quite dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the Leaves and the
Sky said, &ldquo;The water only apes us; it must change its
pictures at our pleasure, and can retain none.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
the Dragon-fly remarked that the height and the depth existed
only in the eyes of the Child, and that the Leaves and the Sky
were true and real only in his thoughts; because in the mind
alone the picture was permanent and enduring, and could be
carried with him whithersoever he went.</p>
<p>This she said to the Child; but she immediately warned him to
return, for the leaves were already beating the tattoo in the
evening breeze, and the lights were disappearing one by one in
every corner.&nbsp; Then the Child confessed to her with alarm
that he knew not how he should find the way back, and that he
feared the dark night would overtake him if he attempted to go
home alone; so the Dragon-fly flew on before him, and showed him
a cave in the rock where he might pass the night.</p>
<p>And the Child was well content; for he had often wished to try
if he could sleep out of his accustomed bed.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the Dragon-fly was fleet, and
gratitude strengthened her wings to pay her host the honour she
owed him.&nbsp; And truly, in the dim twilight good counsel and
guidance were scarce.&nbsp; She flitted hither and thither
without knowing rightly what was to be done; when, by the last
vanishing sunbeam, she saw hanging on the edge of the cave some
strawberries who had drunk so deep of the evening-red, that their
heads were quite heavy.&nbsp; Then she flew up to a Harebell who
stood near, and whispered in her ear that the lord and king of
all the flowers was in the wood, and ought to be received and
welcomed as beseemed his dignity.&nbsp; Aglaia did not need that
this should be repeated.&nbsp; She began to ring her sweet bells
with all her might; and when her neighbour heard the sound, she
rang hers also; and soon all the Harebells, great and small, were
in motion, and rang as if it had been for the nuptials of their
Mother Earth herself with the Prince of the Sun.&nbsp; The tone
of the Bluebells was deep and rich, and that of the white, high
and clear, and all blended together in a delicious harmony.</p>
<p>But the birds were fast asleep in their high nests, and the
ears of the other animals were not delicate enough, or were too
much overgrown with hair, to hear them.&nbsp; The Fire-flies
alone heard the joyous peal, for they were akin to the flowers,
through their common ancestor, Light.&nbsp; They inquired of
their nearest relation, the Lily of the Valley, and from her they
heard that a large flower had just passed along the footpath more
blooming than the loveliest rose, and with two stars more
brilliant than those of the brightest fire-fly, and that it must
needs be their King.&nbsp; Then all the Fire-flies flew up and
down the footpath, and sought everywhere, till at length they
came, as the Dragon-fly had hoped they would, to the cave.</p>
<p>And now, as they looked at the Child, and every one of them
saw itself reflected in his clear eyes, they rejoiced
exceedingly, and called all their fellows together, and alighted
on the bushes all around; and soon it was so light in the cave,
that herb and grass began to grow as if it had been broad
day.&nbsp; Now, indeed, was the joy and triumph of the Dragon-fly
complete.&nbsp; The Child was delighted with the merry and
silvery tones of the bells, and with the many little bright-eyed
companions around him, and with the deep red strawberries which
bowed down their heads to his touch.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> when he had eaten his fill, he
sat down on the soft moss, crossed one little leg over the other,
and began to gossip with the Fire-flies.&nbsp; And as he so often
thought on his unknown parents, he asked them who were their
parents.&nbsp; Then the one nearest to him gave him answer; and
he told how that they were formerly flowers, but none of those
who thrust their rooty hands greedily into the ground and draw
nourishment from the dingy earth, only to make themselves fat and
large withal; but that the light was dearer to them than
anything, even at night; and while the other flowers slept, they
gazed unwearied on the light, and drank it in with eager
adoration&mdash;sun, and moon, and star light.&nbsp; And the
light had so thoroughly purified them, that they had not sucked
in poisonous juices like the yellow flowers of the earth, but
sweet odours for sick and fainting hearts, and oil of potent
ethereal virtue for the weak and the wounded; and at length, when
their autumn came, they did not, like the others, wither and sink
down, leaf and flower, to be swallowed up by the darksome earth,
but shook off their earthly garment and mounted aloft, into the
clear air.&nbsp; But there it was so wondrously bright, that
sight failed them; and when they came to themselves again, they
were fire-flies, each sitting on a withered flower-stalk.</p>
<p>And now the Child liked the bright-eyed flies better than
ever; and he talked a little longer with them, and inquired why
they showed themselves so much more in spring.&nbsp; They did it,
they said, in the hope that their gold-green radiance might
allure their cousins, the flowers, to the pure love of light.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> this conversation the
dragon-fly had been preparing a bed for her host.&nbsp; The moss
upon which the Child sat had grown a foot high behind his back,
out of pure joy; but the dragon-fly and her sisters had so
revelled upon it, that it was now laid at its length along the
cave.&nbsp; The dragon-fly had awakened every spider in the
neighbourhood out of her sleep, and when they saw the brilliant
light, they had set to work spinning so industriously that their
web hung down like a curtain before the mouth of the cave.&nbsp;
But as the Child saw the ant peeping up at him, he entreated the
fire-flies not to deprive themselves any longer of their merry
games in the wood on his account.&nbsp; And the dragon-fly and
her sisters raised the curtain till the Child had laid him down
to rest, and then let it fall again, that the mischievous gnats
might not get in to disturb his slumbers.</p>
<p>The Child laid himself down to sleep, for he was very tired;
but he could not sleep, for his couch of moss was quite another
thing than his little bed, and the cave was all strange to
him.</p>
<p>He turned himself on one side and then on the other, and, as
nothing would do, he raised himself and sat upright to wait till
sleep might choose to come.&nbsp; But sleep would not come at
all; and the only wakeful eyes in the whole wood were the
Child&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For the harebells had rung themselves weary,
and the fire-flies had flown about till they were tired, and even
the dragon-fly, who would fain have kept watch in front of the
cave, had dropped sound asleep.</p>
<p>The wood grew stiller and stiller; here and there fell a dry
leaf which had been driven from its old dwelling place by a fresh
one; here and there a young bird gave a soft chirp when its
mother squeezed it in the nest; and from time to time a gnat
hummed for a minute or two in the curtain, till a spider crept on
tip-toe along its web, and gave him such a gripe in the wind-pipe
as soon spoiled his trumpeting.</p>
<p>And the deeper the silence became, the more intently did the
Child listen, and at last the slightest sound thrilled him from
head to foot.&nbsp; At length, all was still as death in the
wood; and the world seemed as if it never would wake again.&nbsp;
The Child bent forward to see whether it were as dark abroad as
in the cave, but he saw nothing save the pitch-dark night, who
had wrapped everything in her thick veil.&nbsp; Yet as he looked
upwards his eyes met the friendly glance of two or three stars,
and this was a most joyful surprise to him, for he felt himself
no longer so entirely alone.&nbsp; The stars were, indeed, far,
far away, but yet he knew them, and they knew him; for they
looked into his eyes.</p>
<p>The Child&rsquo;s whole soul was fixed in his gaze; and it
seemed to him as if he must needs fly out of the darksome cave,
thither where the stars were beaming with such pure and serene
light; and he felt how poor and lowly he was, when he thought of
their brilliancy; and how cramped and fettered, when he thought
of their free unbounded course along the heavens.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the stars went on their course,
and left their glittering picture only a little while before the
Child&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Even this faded, and then vanished
quite away.&nbsp; And he was beginning to feel tired, and to wish
to lay himself down again, when a flickering
Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp appeared from behind a bush&mdash;so that
the Child thought, at first, one of the stars had wandered out of
its way, and had come to visit him, and to take him with
it.&nbsp; And the Child breathed quick with joy and surprise, and
then the Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp came nearer, and sat himself down
on a damp mossy stone in front of the cave, and another fluttered
quickly after him, and sat down over against him and sighed
deeply, &ldquo;Thank God, then, that I can rest at
last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;for that you may
thank the innocent Child who sleeps there within; it was his pure
breath that freed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you, then,&rdquo; said the Child, hesitatingly,
&ldquo;not of yon stars which wander so brightly there
above?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we were stars,&rdquo; replied the first,
&ldquo;we should pursue our tranquil path through the pure
element, and should leave this wood and the whole darksome earth
to itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;sit brooding on
the face of the shallow pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Child was curious to know who these could be who shone so
beautifully, and yet seemed so discontented.&nbsp; Then the first
began to relate how he had been a child too, and how, as he grew
up, it had always been his greatest delight to deceive people and
play them tricks, to show his wit and cleverness.&nbsp; He had
always, he said, poured such a stream of smooth words over
people, and encompassed himself with such a shining mist, that
men had been attracted by it to their own hurt.&nbsp; But once on
a time there appeared a plain man, who only spoke two or three
simple words, and suddenly the bright mist vanished, and left him
naked and deformed, to the scorn and mockery of the whole
world.&nbsp; But the man had turned away his face from him in
pity, while he was almost dead with shame and anger.&nbsp; And
when he came to himself again, he knew not what had befallen him,
till, at length, he found that it was his fate to hover, without
rest or change, over the surface of the bog as a
Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me it fell out quite otherwise,&rdquo; said the
first: &ldquo;instead of giving light without warmth, as I now
do, I burned without shining.&nbsp; When I was only a child,
people gave way to me in everything, so that I was intoxicated
with self-love.&nbsp; If I saw any one shine, I longed to put out
his light; and the more intensely I wished this, the more did my
own small glimmering turn back upon myself, and inwardly burn
fiercely while all without was darker than ever.&nbsp; But if any
one who shone more brightly would have kindly given me of his
light, then did my inward flame burst forth to destroy him.&nbsp;
But the flame passed through the light and harmed it not; it
shone only the more brightly, while I was withered and
exhausted.&nbsp; And once upon a time I met a little smiling
child, who played with a cross of palm branches, and wore a beamy
coronet around his golden locks.&nbsp; He took me kindly by the
hand and said, &lsquo;My friend, you are now very gloomy and sad,
but if you will become a child again, even as I am, you will have
a bright circlet such as I have.&rsquo;&nbsp; When I heard that,
I was so angry with myself and with the child, that I was
scorched by my inward fire.&nbsp; Now would I fain fly up to the
sun to fetch rays from him, but the rays drove me back with these
words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Return thither whence thou camest, thou dark fire of
envy, for the sun lightens only in love; the greedy earth,
indeed, sometimes turns his mild light into scorching fire.&nbsp;
Fly back, then, for with thy like alone must thou
dwell.&rsquo;&nbsp; I fell, and when I recovered myself I was
glimmering coldly above the stagnant waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were talking the Child had fallen asleep, for he
knew nothing of the world nor of men, and he could make nothing
of their stories.&nbsp; Weariness had spoken a more intelligible
language to him&mdash;<i>that</i> he understood, and he had
fallen asleep.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Softly</span> and soundly he slept till
the rosy morning clouds stood upon the mountain, and announced
the coming of their lord, the sun.&nbsp; But as soon as the
tidings spread over field and wood, the thousand-voiced echo
awoke, and sleep was no more to be thought of.</p>
<p>And soon did the royal sun himself arise; at first his
dazzling diadem alone appeared above the mountains; at length he
stood upon their summit in the full majesty of his beauty, in all
the charms of eternal youth, bright and glorious, his kindly
glance embracing every creature of earth, from the stately oak to
the blade of grass bending under the foot of the wayfaring
man.&nbsp; Then arose from every breast, from every throat, the
joyous song of praise; and it was as if the whole plain and wood
were become a temple, whose roof was the heaven, whose altar the
mountain, whose congregation all creatures, whose priest the
sun.</p>
<p>But the Child walked forth and was glad, for the birds sang
sweetly, and it seemed to him as if everything sported and danced
out of mere joy to be alive.&nbsp; Here flew two finches through
the thicket, and, twittering, pursued each other; there, the
young buds burst asunder, and the tender leaves peeped out and
expanded themselves in the warm sun, as if they would abide in
his glance for ever; here, a dewdrop trembled, sparkling and
twinkling on a blade of grass, and knew not that beneath him
stood a little moss who was thirsting after him; there, troops of
flies flew aloft, as if they would soar far, far over the wood:
and so all was life and motion, and the Child&rsquo;s heart joyed
to see it.</p>
<p>He sat down on a little smooth plot of turf, shaded by the
branches of a nut-bush, and thought he should now sip the cup of
his delight, drop by drop.&nbsp; And first he plucked down some
brambles which threatened him with their prickles; then he bent
aside some branches which concealed the view; then he removed the
stones, so that he might stretch out his feet at full length on
the soft turf; and when he had done all this, he bethought
himself what was yet to do; and as he found nothing, he stood up
to look for his acquaintance the dragon-fly, and to beg her to
guide him once more out of the wood into the open fields.&nbsp;
About midway he met her, and she began to excuse herself for
having fallen asleep in the night.&nbsp; The Child thought not of
the past, were it even but a minute ago, so earnestly did he now
wish to get out from among the thick and close trees; for his
heart beat high, and he felt as if he should breathe freer in the
open ground.&nbsp; The dragon-fly flew on before and showed him
the way as far as the outermost verge of the wood, whence the
Child could espy his own little hut, and then flew away to her
playfellows.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Child walked forth alone upon
the fresh dewy cornfield.&nbsp; A thousand little suns glittered
in his eyes, and a lark soared warbling above his head.&nbsp; And
the lark proclaimed the joys of the coming year, and awakened
endless hopes, while she soared circling higher and higher, till,
at length, her song was like the soft whisper of an angel holding
converse with the spring, under the blue arch of heaven.&nbsp;
The Child had seen the earth-coloured little bird rise up before
him, and it seemed to him as if the earth had sent her forth from
her bosom as a messenger to carry her joy and her thanks up to
the sun, because he had turned his beaming countenance again upon
her in love and bounty.&nbsp; And the lark hung poised above the
hope-giving field, and warbled her clear and joyous song.</p>
<p>She sang of the loveliness of the rosy dawn, and the fresh
brilliancy of the earliest sunbeams; of the gladsome springing of
the young flowers, and the vigorous shooting of the corn; and her
song pleased the Child beyond measure.</p>
<p>But the lark wheeled in higher and higher circles, and her
song sounded softer and sweeter.</p>
<p>And now she sang of the first delights of early love; of
wanderings together on the sunny fresh hilltops, and of the sweet
pictures and visions that arise out of the blue and misty
distance.&nbsp; The Child understood not rightly what he heard,
and fain would he have understood, for he thought that even in
such visions must be wondrous delight.&nbsp; He gazed aloft after
the unwearied bird, but she had disappeared in the morning
mist.</p>
<p>Then the Child leaned his head on one shoulder to listen if he
could no longer hear the little messenger of spring; and he could
just catch the distant and quivering notes in which she sang of
the fervent longing after the clear element of freedom, after the
pure all-present light, and of the blessed foretaste of this
desired enfranchisement, of this blending in the sea of celestial
happiness.</p>
<p>Yet longer did he listen, for the tones of her song carried
him there, where, as yet, his thoughts had never reached, and he
felt himself happier in this short and imperfect flight than ever
he had felt before.&nbsp; But the lark now dropped suddenly to
the earth, for her little body was too heavy for the ambient
ether, and her wings were not large nor strong enough for the
pure element.</p>
<p>Then the red corn-poppies laughed at the homely looking bird,
and cried to one another and to the surrounding blades of corn in
a shrill voice, &ldquo;Now, indeed, you may see what comes of
flying so high, and striving and straining after mere air; people
only lose their time, and bring back nothing but weary wings and
an empty stomach.&nbsp; That vulgar-looking ill-dressed little
creature would fain raise herself above us all, and has kept up a
mighty noise.&nbsp; And now there she lies on the ground and can
hardly breathe, while we have stood still where we are sure of a
good meal, and have stayed, like people of sense, where there is
something substantial to be had; and in the time she has been
fluttering and singing, we have grown a good deal taller and
fatter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other little redcaps chattered and screamed their assent
so loud that the Child&rsquo;s ears tingled, and he wished he
could chastise them for their spiteful jeers; when a cyane said,
in a soft voice, to her younger playmates, &ldquo;Dear friends,
be not led astray by outward show, nor by discourse which regards
only outward show.&nbsp; The lark is, indeed, weary, and the
space into which she has soared is void; but the void is not what
the lark sought, nor is the seeker returned empty home.&nbsp; She
strove after light and freedom, and light and freedom has she
proclaimed.&nbsp; She left the earth and its enjoyments, but she
has drunk of the pure air of heaven, and has seen that it is not
the earth, but the sun that is steadfast.&nbsp; And if earth has
called her back, it can keep nothing of her but what is its
own.&nbsp; Her sweet voice and her soaring wings belong to the
sun, and will enter into light and freedom long after the foolish
prater shall have sunk and been buried in the dark prison of the
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the lark heard her wise and friendly discourse, and with
renewed strength she sprang once more into the clear and
beautiful blue.</p>
<p>Then the Child clapped his little hands for joy, that the
sweet bird had flown up again, and that the redcaps must hold
their tongues for shame.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> the Child was become happy and
joyful, and breathed freely again, and thought no more of
returning to his hut, for he saw that nothing returned inwards,
but rather that all strove outwards into the free air; the rosy
apple blossoms from their narrow buds, and the gurgling notes
from the narrow breast of the lark.&nbsp; The germs burst open
the folding doors of the seeds, and broke through the heavy
pressure of the earth in order to get at the light; the grasses
tore asunder their bands, and their slender blades sprung
upward.&nbsp; Even the rocks were become gentle, and allowed
little mosses to peep out from their sides, as a sign that they
would not remain impenetrably closed for ever.&nbsp; And the
flowers sent out colour and fragrance into the whole world, for
they kept not their best for themselves, but would imitate the
sun and the stars, which poured their warmth and radiance over
the spring.&nbsp; And many a little gnat and beetle burst the
narrow cell in which it was enclosed and crept out slowly, and,
half asleep, unfolded and shook its tender wings, and soon gained
strength, and flew off to untried delights.&nbsp; And as the
butterflies came forth from their chrysalids in all their gaiety
and splendour, so did every humbled and suppressed aspiration and
hope free itself, and boldly launch into the open and flowing sea
of spring.</p>
<h2>HYMNS TO NIGHT.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Translated from the German of
Novalis</i>.)</p>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> that has life and intelligence,
loves not, before all the surrounding miracles of space,
ever-joyous light with its tints, its beams, and its waves, its
mild omnipresence, when it comes as the waking day.&nbsp; Like
the inmost soul of life, it is inhaled by the giant universe of
gleaming stars, that dance as they swim in its blue flood; it is
inhaled by the glittering, eternally motionless stone, by the
living plant that drinks it in, by the wild and impetuous beast
in its many forms; but above all, by the glorious stranger, with
eyes of intellect, majestic step, with lips melodious, and gently
closed.&nbsp; As a king over earthly nature, it calls forth to
countless changes every power, binds and loosens bonds
unnumbered, and hangs around every earthly being its heavenly
picture.&nbsp; Alone its presence declares the wondrous glory of
the kingdoms the world.</p>
<p>I turn aside to the holy, the inexpressible, the mysterious
Night.&nbsp; Afar off lies the world, buried in some deep chasm:
desolate and lonely is the spot it filled.&nbsp; Through the
chords of the breast sighs deepest sorrow.&nbsp; I will sink down
into the dewdrops, and with ashes will I be commingled.&nbsp; The
distant lines of memory, desires of youth, the dreams of
childhood, a whole life&rsquo;s short joys and hopes vain,
unfulfilled, come clothed in grey, like evening mists, when the
sun&rsquo;s glory has departed.&nbsp; Elsewhere has the light
broken upon habitations of gladness.&nbsp; What, should it never
return again to its children, who with the faith of innocence
await its coming?</p>
<p>What fount is thus suddenly opened within the heart, so full
of forethought, that destroys the soft breath of sorrow?&nbsp;
Thou also&mdash;dost thou love us, gloomy Night?&nbsp; What
holdest thou concealed beneath thy mantle that draws my soul
towards thee with such mysterious power?&nbsp; Costly balsam
raineth from thy hand; from thy horn pourest thou out manna; the
heavy wings of the spirit liftest thou.&nbsp; Darkly and
inexpressibly do we feel ourselves moved: a solemn countenance I
behold with glad alarm, that bends towards me in gentle
contemplation, displaying, among endless allurements of the
mother, lovely youth!&nbsp; How poor and childish does the light
now seem!&nbsp; How joyous and how hallowed is the day&rsquo;s
departure!&mdash;Therefore then only, because Night dismissed thy
vassals, hast thou sown in the infinity of space those shining
balls to declare thine almighty power, and thy return in the
season of absence?&nbsp; More heavenly than those glittering
stars seem the unnumbered eyes that Night has opened within
us.&nbsp; Farther can they see than beyond the palest of that
countless host; without need of light can they pierce the depths
of a spirit of love, that fills a yet more glorious space with
joy beyond expression.&nbsp; Glory to the world&rsquo;s Queen,
the high declarer of spheres of holiness, the nurse of hallowed
love!&nbsp; Thee, thou tenderly beloved one, doth she send to
me&mdash;thee, lovely sun of the Night.&nbsp; Now I awaken, for I
am thine and mine: the Night hast thou given as a sign of life,
and made me man.&nbsp; Devour with glowing spiritual fire this
earthly body, that I ethereal may abide with thee in union yet
more perfect, and then may the bridal Night endure for ever.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Must</span> ever the morn return?&nbsp; Is
there no end to the sovereignty of earth?&nbsp; Unhallowed
occupation breaks the heavenly pinion of the Night.&nbsp; Shall
the secret offering of love at no time burn for ever?&nbsp; To
the Light is its period allotted; but beyond time and space is
the empire of the Night.&nbsp; Eternal is the duration of
sleep.&nbsp; Thou holy sleep! bless not too rarely the
Night&rsquo;s dedicated son in this earth&rsquo;s daily
work!&nbsp; Fools alone recognise thee not, and know of no sleep
beyond the shadow which in that twilight of the actual Night thou
throwest in compassion over us.&nbsp; They feel thee not in the
vine&rsquo;s golden flood, in the almond-tree&rsquo;s marvel oil,
and in the brown juice of the manna; they know not that it is
thou that enhaloest the tender maiden&rsquo;s breast, and makest
a heaven of her bosom; conceive not that out of histories of old
thou steppest forth an opener of heaven, and bearest the key to
the abodes of the blessed, the silent messenger of unending
mysteries.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span>, when I was shedding bitter
tears, when my hope streamed away dissolved in sorrow, and I
stood alone beside the barren hill, that concealed in narrow
gloomy space the form of my existence&mdash;alone, as never
solitary yet hath been, urged by an agony beyond expression,
powerless, no more than a mere thought of sorrow; as I looked
around me there for aid, could not advance, could not retire, and
hung with incessant longing upon fleeting, failing
life;&mdash;then came there from the blue distance, from the
heights of my former happiness, a thin veil of the twilight
gloom, and in a moment burst the bondage of the fetters of the
birth of light.&nbsp; Then fled the glories of the earth, and all
my sorrow with them; sadness melted away in a new, an
unfathomable world; thou, inspiration of the Night, slumber of
heaven, camest over me; the spot whereon I stood rose insensibly
on high; above the spot soared forth my released and new-born
spirit.&nbsp; The hill became a cloud of dust; through the cloud
I beheld the revealed features of my beloved one.&nbsp; In her
eyes eternity reposed; I grasped her hands, and my tears formed a
glittering, inseparable bond.&nbsp; Ages were swept by like
storms into the distance; on her neck I wept tears of ecstasy for
life renewed.&nbsp; It was my first, my only dream; and from that
time I feel an eternal and unchanging faith in the heaven of the
Night, and in its light, the Loved One.</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> do I know when the last morn
will be; when the light shall no more give alarm to the night and
to love; when the slumber shall be without end, and there shall
be but one exhaustless dream.&nbsp; Heavenly weariness do I feel
within me.&nbsp; Long and wearisome had become the pilgrimage to
the holy grave&mdash;the cross a burthen.&nbsp; He who hath
tasted of the crystal wave that gushes forth, unknown to common
eye, in the dark bosom of that hill, against whose foot the flood
of earthly waves is dashed and broken; he who hath stood upon the
summit of the world&rsquo;s mountain bounds, and hath looked
beyond them down into that new land, into the abode of Night; he,
well I ween, turns not back into the turmoil of the
world&mdash;into the land where the light, and eternal unrest,
dwells.</p>
<p>There, above, does he erect his huts&mdash;his huts of peace;
there longs and loves, until comes the most welcome of all hours
to draw him down into that fountain&rsquo;s source.&nbsp; Upon
the surface floats all that is earthly&mdash;it is hurried back
by storms; but that which was hallowed by the breath of love,
freely streams it forth, through hidden paths, into that realm
beyond the mountain chain, and there, exhaled as incense, becomes
mixed with loves that have slept.&nbsp; Still, cheerful light,
dost thou waken the weary to his toil, still pourest thou glad
life into my breast; but from the mossy monument that memory has
raised, thence canst thou not allure me.&nbsp; Willingly will I
employ my hands in industry and toil; I will look around me at
thy bidding; I will celebrate the full glory of thy splendour;
trace out, untired, the beauteous consistency of thy wondrous
work; willingly will I mark the marvellous course of thy mighty,
glowing timepiece; observe the balance of gigantic powers, and
the laws of the wondrous play of countless spaces and their
periods.&nbsp; But true to the Night remains my heart of hearts,
and to creative Love, her daughter.&nbsp; Canst thou show me a
heart for ever faithful?&nbsp; Hath thy sun fond eyes that know
me?&nbsp; Do thy stars clasp my proffered hand?&nbsp; Do they
return the tender pressure, the caressing word?&nbsp; Hast thou
clothed her with fair hues and pleasing outline?&nbsp; Or was it
she who gave thine ornament a higher, dearer meaning?&nbsp; What
pleasure, what enjoyment, can thy life afford, that shall
overweigh the ecstasies of death?&nbsp; Bears not everything that
inspires us the colours of the Night?&nbsp; Thee she cherishes
with a mother&rsquo;s care; to her thou owest all thy
majesty.&nbsp; Thou hadst melted in thyself, hadst been dissolved
in endless space, had she not restrained and encircled thee, so
that thou wert warm, and gavest life to the world.&nbsp; Verily I
was, before thou wert: the mother sent me with my sisters to
inhabit thy world, to hallow it with love, so that it might be
gazed on as a memorial for ever, to plant it with unfading
flowers.&nbsp; As yet they have borne no fruit, these godlike
thoughts; but few as yet are the traces of our revelation.&nbsp;
The day shall come when thy timepiece pointeth to the end of
time, when thou shalt be even as one of us; and, filled with
longing and ardent love, be blotted out and die.&nbsp; Within my
soul I feel the end of thy distracted power, heavenly freedom,
hailed return.&nbsp; In wild sorrow I recognise thy distance from
our home, thy hostility towards the ancient glorious
heaven.&nbsp; In vain are thy tumult and thy rage.&nbsp;
Indestructible remains the cross&mdash;a victorious banner of our
race.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I wander over,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every tear<br />
To gem our pleasure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will then appear.<br />
A few more hours,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I find my rest<br />
In maddening bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the loved one&rsquo;s breast.<br />
Life, never ending,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swells mighty in me;<br />
I look from above down&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look back upon thee.<br />
By yonder hillock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Expires thy beam;<br />
And comes with a shadow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cooling gleam.<br />
Oh, call me, thou loved one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With strength from above;<br />
That I may slumber,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wake to love.<br />
I welcome death&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reviving flood;<br />
To balm and to ether<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It changes my blood.<br />
I live through each day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Filled with faith and desire;<br />
And die when the Night comes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In heaven-born fire.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> the widely-spreading races of
mankind, ruled aforetime an iron Destiny with silent power.&nbsp;
A dark and heavy band was around man&rsquo;s anxious soul;
without end was the earth; the home of the gods and their
abode.&nbsp; Throughout eternities had her mysterious structure
stood.&nbsp; Beyond the red mountains of the morning, in the holy
bosom of the sea, there dwelt the Sun, the all-inflaming, living
light.&nbsp; A hoary giant bare the sacred world.&nbsp; Securely
prisoned, beneath mountains, lay the first sons of the mother
Earth, powerless in their destructive fury against the new and
glorious race of the gods, and their kindred, joyous men.&nbsp;
The dark, green ocean&rsquo;s depth was the bosom of a
goddess.&nbsp; In the crystal grottoes rioted a voluptuous
tribe.&nbsp; Rivers, trees, flowers, and brute beasts had human
understanding.&nbsp; Sweeter was the wine poured forth by
youth&rsquo;s soft bloom; a god in the vine&rsquo;s clusters; a
loving, a maternal goddess, shooting forth among the full, golden
sheaves; love&rsquo;s holy flame, a delicious service to the most
beauteous of the goddesses.&nbsp; An ever gay and joyous festival
of heaven&rsquo;s children and the dwellers upon earth, life
rustled on as a spring, through centuries.&nbsp; All races
venerated, like children, the tender, thousand-fold flame, as the
highest of the world; one thought only was there, one hideous
vision of a dream:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;That fearful to the joyous tables
came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the gay soul in wild distraction shrouded.<br />
Here could the gods themselves no counsel frame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That might console the breast with sorrow
clouded.<br />
This monster&rsquo;s path mysterious, still the same,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unstilled his rage, though prayers on gifts were
crowded.<br />
His name was Death, who with distress of soul,<br />
Anguish and tears, on the hour of pleasure stole.</p>
<p class="poetry">For ever now from everything departed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That here can swell the heart with sweet delight,<br
/>
Torn now from the beloved one, who, sad-hearted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On earth could but desire and grief excite,<br />
A feeble dream seemed to the dead imparted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Powerless striving made man&rsquo;s only right;<br
/>
And broken was enjoyment&rsquo;s heaving billow,<br />
Upon the rock of endless care, its pillow.</p>
<p class="poetry">With daring mind, as heavenly fancy glows,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Man masks the fearful shape with fair resembling:<br
/>
His torch put out, a mild youth doth repose;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soft is the end as the lyre&rsquo;s mournful
trembling.<br />
Remembrance fades i&rsquo; the gloom a shadow throws:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So sang the song, a dreadful doom dissembling.<br />
Yet undefined remained eternal Night,<br />
The stern reminder of some distant might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length the old world bowed its head.&nbsp; The gay gardens
of the young race were withered; beyond into the freer, desert
space aspired less childish and maturing man.&nbsp; The gods then
vanished with their train.&nbsp; Lonely and lifeless, Nature
stood.&nbsp; The scanty number and the rigid measure bound her
with fetters of iron.&nbsp; As into dust and air melted the
inconceivable blossoms of life into mysterious words.&nbsp; Fled
was the magic faith, and phantasy the all-changing, all-uniting
friend from heaven.&nbsp; Over the rigid earth, unfriendly, blew
a cold north wind, and the wonder-home, now without life, was
lost in ether; the recesses of the heavens were filled with
beaming worlds.&nbsp; Into a holier sphere, into the mind&rsquo;s
far higher space, did the world draw the soul with its powers,
there to wander until the break of the world&rsquo;s dawning
glory.&nbsp; No longer was the light the gods&rsquo; abode, their
token in the heavens: the veil of the night did they cast over
them.&nbsp; The night was the mighty bosom of revelations; in it
the gods returned, and slumbered there, to go forth in new and in
more glorious forms over the altered world.</p>
<p>Among the people above all despised, too soon matured, and
wilful strangers to the blessed innocence of youth; among them,
with features hitherto unseen, the new world came, in the
poet&rsquo;s hut of poverty, a son of the first virgin mother,
endless fruit of a mysterious embrace.&nbsp; The boding, budding
wisdom of the East first recognised another Time&rsquo;s
beginning; to the humble cradle of the monarch their star
declared the way.&nbsp; In the name of the distant future, with
splendour and with incense, did they make offering to him, the
highest wonder of the world.&nbsp; In solitude did the heavenly
heart unfold to a flowery chalice of almighty love, bent towards
the holy countenance of the father, and resting on the
happily-expectant bosom of the lovely pensive mother.&nbsp; With
divine ardour did the prophetic eye of the blooming child look
forth into the days of the future, towards his beloved, the
offspring of the race of God, careless for his day&rsquo;s
earthly destiny.&nbsp; The most child-like spirits, wondrously
seized with a deep, heart-felt love, collected soon around him;
as flowers, a new and unknown life budded forth upon his
path.&nbsp; Words inexhaustible, the gladdest tidings fell, as
sparks from a heavenly spirit, from his friendly lips.&nbsp; From
a distant coast, born under Hellas&rsquo; cheerful sky, a
minstrel came to Palestine, and yielded his whole heart to the
wondrous child:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The youth art thou, who for uncounted
time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon our graves hast stood with hidden meaning;<br
/>
In hours of darkness a consoling sign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of higher manhood&rsquo;s joyous, hailed
beginning;<br />
That which hath made our soul so long to pine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now draws us hence, sweet aspirations winning.<br />
In Death, eternal Life hath been revealed:<br />
And thou art Death, by thee we first are healed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minstrel wandered, full of joy, towards Hindostan, the
heart elated with the sweetest love, which, beneath yonder
heavens, he poured forth in fiery songs, so that a thousand
hearts inclined towards him, and with a thousand branches grew
towards heaven the joyous tidings.&nbsp; Soon after the
minstrel&rsquo;s departure, the precious life became a sacrifice
to the deep guilt of man: he died in youthful years, torn from
the world he loved, from the weeping mother and lamenting
friends.&nbsp; His mouth of love emptied the dark cup of
inexpressible affliction.&nbsp; In fearful anguish approached the
hour of the new world&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp; Deeply was he touched
with the old world&rsquo;s fearful death&mdash;the weight of the
old world fell heavily upon him.&nbsp; Once more he gazed
placidly upon the mother, then came the loosening hand of eternal
love, and he slumbered.&nbsp; Few days only hung a deep veil over
the swelling sea, over the quaking land; the beloved ones wept
countless tears; the mystery was unsealed: the ancient stone
heavenly spirits raised from the dark grave.&nbsp; Angels sat
beside the slumberer, tenderly formed out of his dreams.&nbsp;
Awakened in the new glory of a god, he ascended the height of the
new-born world; and with his own hand buried within the deserted
sepulchre the old one&rsquo;s corpse, and with almighty hand
placed over it the stone no power can raise.</p>
<p>Yet do thy dear ones weep rich tears of joy, tears of emotion,
and of eternal gratitude beside thy grave; even yet, with glad
alarm, do they behold thee rise, themselves with thee; behold
thee weeping, with sweet feeling, on the happy bosom of thy
mother, solemnly walking with thy friends, speaking words as if
broken from the tree of life; see thee hasten, full of longing,
to thy Father&rsquo;s arms, bringing the young race of man, and
the cup of a golden future, which shall never be exhausted.&nbsp;
The mother soon followed thee in heavenly triumph; she was the
first to join thee in the new home.&nbsp; Long ages have flown by
since then, and ever in yet higher glory hath thy new creation
grown, and thousands from out of pain and misery have, full of
faith and longing, followed thee; roam with thee and the heavenly
virgin in the realm of love, serve in the temple of heavenly
Death, and are in eternity thine.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Lifted is the stone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Manhood hath arisen:<br />
Still are we thine own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unharmed by bond or prison.<br />
When earth&mdash;life&mdash;fade away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last meal&rsquo;s solemn gladness,<br />
Around thy cup dare stray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No trace of grief or sadness.</p>
<p class="poetry">To the marriage, Death doth call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The brilliant lamps are lighted;<br />
The virgins come, invited,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And oil is with them all.<br />
Space now to space is telling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How forth thy train hath gone,<br />
The voice of stars is swelling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With human tongue and tone!</p>
<p class="poetry">To thee, Maria, hallowed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A thousand hearts are sent;<br />
In this dark life and shadowed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On thee their thoughts are bent:<br />
The soul&rsquo;s releasement seeing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They, longing, seek its rest;<br />
By thee pressed, holy being,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon thy faithful breast.</p>
<p class="poetry">How many who, once glowing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth&rsquo;s bitterness have learned,<br />
Their souls with grief o&rsquo;erflowing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To thee have sadly turned;<br />
Thou pitying hast appear&eacute;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In many an hour of pain;<br />
We come to thee now, wearied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There ever to remain.</p>
<p class="poetry">By no cold grave now weepeth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A faithful love, forlorn;<br />
Each still love&rsquo;s sweet rights keepeth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From none will they be torn.<br />
To soften his sad longing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fires doth Night impart;<br />
From heaven cherubs thronging,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold watch upon his heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">Content, our life advancing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To a life that shall abide,<br />
Each flame its worth enhancing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul is glorified.<br />
The starry host shall sink then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bright and living wine,<br />
The golden draught we drink then,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stars ourselves shall shine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Love released, lives woundless,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No separation more;<br />
While life swells free and boundless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As a sea without a shore.<br />
One night of glad elation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One joy that cannot die,<br />
And the sun of all creation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the face of the Most High.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">LONGING FOR DEATH.</span></h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Below</span>, within the
earth&rsquo;s dark breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From realms of light departing,<br />
There sorrow&rsquo;s pang and sigh oppressed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is signal of our starting.<br />
In narrow boat we ferry o&rsquo;er<br />
Speedily to heaven&rsquo;s shore.</p>
<p class="poetry">To us be hallowed endless Night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hallowed eternal slumber!<br />
The day hath withered us with light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And troubles beyond number.<br />
No more &rsquo;mong strangers would we roam;<br />
We seek our Father, and our home.</p>
<p class="poetry">Upon this world, what do we here,<br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
